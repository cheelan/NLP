begin.v 0 0 1 0 0 @ It is here that an anthropological observing participation comes into its own , for in living with the semantics of the system the analyst has the potential to undertake a rarely used method of social research . This contains the experience and depth of the insider 's knowledge , which Holdaway ( 1979 ) recognizes is unlikely to become readily available , simply because there is a lack of impetus within contemporary sociology to spend lengthy periods of observation in what may be uncomfortable research situations with the police . And here the problem really @begins@ , for the ethnographer must explore beyond the public presentation of self , to seek the underlying discourses of police reality . Inevitably this takes the researcher beyond the press release , the statistical return , or the folk explanation and into an interpretive framework , perhaps to seek how these presentations are used ( often unconsciously ) as part of a well - constructed formula to replicate positions of power and support the ideology and practices of the institution . Immediately the police officer/anthropologist sets out to undertake research or record fieldnotes he is forced to confront a moral dilemma .

According to the Liberal - Irish alliance , the Irish party was supposed to abstain from the 1901 Conservative bill , aimed at bringing denominational schools in England and Wales into the national education system while at the same time absenting them from local government control : that is , giving finance while maintaining the system of denominational clerical control .

They knew the owners , the well - to - do , the grandees back from Jamaica and Bengal who sat here now behind tall walls and drew their rents . Down beyond the fork where the Taly joined the Tummel another world @began@ the world of government . The axis that joined Edinburgh to London that was the lightning - rod of power . Sir John Menzies was part of that , by his marriage to Atholl 's daughter , and Atholl dined and intrigued with the Lord Advocate when he went to Edinburgh for the season .

Don't stop there , said Jay , pouring wine and @beginning@ to understand why Jeremy was so precious , to be redeemed from his traumas and late - night binges even at the age of twenty - five . Well , I decided I wanted a divorce . And I wanted my son .

This nearly always results in drifting further back without much gain of height and ending up in a worse situation than before . If it @begins@ to look doubtful that the site can be reached and the glider is down to 1,000 feet , it is time to select the best possible field within easy reach and to make a safe landing in it .

It is like hanging day in the Grassmarket .

Dear Harsnet , he wrote , the distance between London and Brighton is not very great , and you have even been seen in the vicinity of Brighton , so why not call in on an old friend ? The circle in place , wrote Harsnet ( and Goldberg @began@ to type again ) . Locks that part of the glass together . And finally gives charts the kind of breathing space they did n't quite have before .
