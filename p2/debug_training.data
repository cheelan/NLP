begin.v 0 1 0 0 0 @ Accidental stalls seldom happen when the glider is being flown straight , and most result in one wing stalling before the other , causing a wing - drop . Incipient spins Any time that a wing @begins@ to drop at a stall it is the beginning of a possible spin , but the spin can only develop if the wing is kept stalled and the glider is allowed to continue to yaw . In the UK there has been much discussion about teaching stall recoveries with a view to making it all easier for the beginner to understand and remember . It has been suggested that incipient is an unfamiliar word , that associating the stall with a spin might get the student worried , and that to simplify things we should only talk about stalls and spins .
begin.v 0 0 1 0 0 @ Such material clearly illustrates the new modes of thought we were developing . Our new semantic understanding was therefore linked to the changing epiphenomena of dress , hair , clothing , and the other symbols of the body I have mentioned ; but it was also manifest in an irrepressible need to reinterpret and question the social condition , for I had journeyed beyond the norms of the police system , where action to control is preferably a simple matter of enforcing the rules and regulations as they stand . Yet this move into anti - structure was merely @beginning@ . The unconventional , questioning form I had begun to pursue was rewarded by an invitation in 1972 to attend United Nations European Social Affairs Division in Geneva . Experts from a variety of European agencies were brought together to discuss and report on the various cross - cultural attitudes to drug - taking among young people .

The lime was mixed with flowers of sulphur so that the walls would give off sulphurous fumes when they got warm . Limewashing @began@ in October and all the houses had to be finished by the end of February , as many would then have the heat turned up to set their inmates into growth . It was also during the winter months that vines were taken down from their wires and their ends tied ( often to the water pipes ) so that they formed a large bow shape . This checked the sap and induced even growth .
