In this context , texture is the visual equivalent of the feel of a given surface . In wood this is @produced@ by flecking ( oak ) , ripple ( mahogany ) , sheen ( satinwood ) , dappling ( lacewood ) , and even insect attack ( masur birch ) !

Firstly , they need lots of exercise and they must be welltrained and socialised , Graham explained . When buying a puppy , try and ensure it is well - bred and reared by a breeder who has some aim to @produce@ well - tempered stock . Graham emphasised the fact that the breed needs plenty of mental exercise , too , even if it 's only basic obedience training . It is no good you being a couch potato and having a Dobermann , only to wonder why it seems so frustrated with its existence .

Quality in photographs costs money but it is an outlay that is never wasted for casting directors and producers do look at volumes of Spotlight repeatedly . In recent years , photographs of newcomers to the profession have been put together in a volume expressly @produced@ for that purpose , by Spotlight .

As a Greek and Latin scholar he had found them described in the works of ancient authors who wrote about the moods , emotions and actions of all the actors involved in their dramas . By 1717 these gestures were accepted practice by actors to reinforce the meaning of the words spoken and particularly by members of the commedia dell'arte travelling troupes who @produced@ mime plays . In these the expert gestures and extemporised playing of easily recognised characters in certain stock situations were understood by audiences everywhere no matter what the native language because the gestures were so explicit .

This so impressed the then president of the Canadian branch of the Anglo Jewish Association that he invited the young man , scarcely more than a boy , to be its secretary ; the start of a highly successful and very wide range of business and charitable interests . Quite apart from his business acumen ( by the end of his commercial life he was the head of the largest clothing manufacturers which his father had acquired earlier , originally named Freedmans in the British dominions , as well as chairman or president of the most important trade bodies related to that industry ) he held very senior positions in such organisations as the Baron de Hirsch Institute , the Montreal Reform Club , the Montefiore Club , the Montreal Insurance Co , the Jewish Public Library , the Hebrew Educational Institute , the Canadian Jewish Committee for the Relief of War Sufferers in Europe , the Executive of the Canadian Jewish Congress , the Canadian Colonisation Committee , the Zion Athletic Club , the Zionist Organisation of Canada , and many , many more .
