Swift changes in the dimensions covered in any linear design are nowhere more obvious than in Ashton 's five abstract ballets and his example is now being followed by David Bintley in his Choros and Consort Lessons . In fact such unusual movements often arouse the @audience@ to gentle laughter as swift changes add a touch of humour as two or more dancers compete to capture the attention of both the @audience@ and their Colleagues .

The style must disclose and be expressive of the moods , emotions and actions of the roles played even where few personal feelings are allowed to show , as in such ballets as Ashton 's Monotones where all that is needed is a calm , unhurried and seemingly endless weaving of the dance design in all its dimensions . Nevertheless the three dancers in Monotones are expressing their close relationship to each other and to the space in which they dance and above all to the flowing lines of the design and of the musical phrases .

Midland could be its passport for survival after 1997 though , like all Hongkong passports these days , a costly one .
degree.n 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ To describe self - governed perceptual sequences , Kant gave the example of scanning the front elevation of a building ; in doing which we determine what we see and the order in which we see it roof , front - door , top - left - hand window , and so forth . Obviously , each kind of experience necessarily contains elements of the other. Thus , there is some @degree@ of selfdetermination in the ship case because we are free to shut our eyes , to cross the river and see it move from right to left , free to jump into the water and watch it coming towards us , free to determine the speed with which it passes across our visual field by moving our eyes with or against its movement . In the house example , we can choose the order in which we see the parts of the building but we surely cannot see occluded portions , and we surely cannot look up to see a thatched roof because that 's the kind of roof we want to see when the roof is tiled . In fact , in every microsecond of perceptual experience there is a tension between the real as refractory , as something we cannot choose or will , and the subjective as chosen and willed .

All dogs , of any breed , have a @degree@ of aggression , Graham said . This is how they establish their pecking order in the pack . It is a trait which is essential to any canine 's make - up.
degree.n 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 @ Through the late 1980s another force was at work which turned the Provincial sector 's fortunes further round . Increasing prosperity in the United Kingdom meant that people had more spare cash , and much of this was spent on an increase in personal travel . The new trains on the Provincial routes therefore had a market with a @degree@ of positive elasticity not previously enjoyed . Inevitably the services which had been planned on the basis of high seat - load factors quickly became overcrowded . Provincial had been bitten by its own success .

Though the college was very Anglican , he retained all his family 's loyalty to the Congregationalist tradition and way of worship . After a time teaching in a Scottish school , Fettes , the @degree@ got him a fellowship in mathematics at his own college of Magdalene ; where he remained the rest of his long life teaching mathematics , holding various college offices , going every week to Emmanuel Congregational chapel , and becoming after a time one of its deacons or church officers . He was a good mathematical teacher and he wrote a number of text - books , some of which went on selling into the 198os . To the outward eye he was austere , even bleak .
degree.n 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 @ Universities and colleges are looking to expand their intakes , but are drawing on a shrinking population of 18 - year - olds . Increasingly , they are taking students with non A - level qualifications and finding that many of them perform superbly . The glitter of A - levels in today 's broader , more diverse , @degree@ market is starting to tarnish , and is unlikely ever to be restored to its former glory . A further problem with A - levels is the narrowness they impose on students . Our high - flying 18 - year - olds are superbly grounded in their specialist areas , compared to their counterparts in other Western countries , but we seem incapable of producing engineers with a fluent second language , or historians who understand information technology .

Everything depends on the @degree@ of the condition , as determined by social services following medical advice . Mrs Finni will apply , without much optimism . They 're crafty ; very hard to get anything out of .
degree.n 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 @ The brewery has only horizontal tanks , in which the fermenting wort is a mere 2.8 metres high . People in Bavaria say it is crazy not to have tall cylindro - conicals in a wholly ultra - modern brewery , says Brombach , but I think that kind of vessel sets up a convection that makes for dirty beer . CLEAN beer is something of an obsession at Erdinger , which works to tolerances of a tenth of a @degree@ of temperature , from mashing to fermentation , and is coy about revealing the details of either . The filtered beer is tank conditioned , but the greater part of output has a secondary fermentation in the bottle . For this purpose , it is primed with wort , and pre - yeasted with a bottom culture .

This gives each band member a @degree@ of security . If there is no formal agreement between the band members , and if the band has been working in practice as a partnership , I have always viewed the band as operating as if there were a formal partnership agreement . In that case , the following rules normally apply .
