This contains the experience and depth of the insider 's knowledge , which Holdaway ( 1979 ) recognizes is unlikely to become readily available , simply because there is a lack of impetus within contemporary sociology to spend lengthy periods of observation in what may be uncomfortable research situations with the police . And here the problem really @begins@ , for the ethnographer must explore beyond the public presentation of self , to seek the underlying discourses of police reality . Inevitably this takes the researcher beyond the press release , the statistical return , or the folk explanation and into an interpretive framework , perhaps to seek how these presentations are used ( often unconsciously ) as part of a well - constructed formula to replicate positions of power and support the ideology and practices of the institution . Immediately the police officer/anthropologist sets out to undertake research or record fieldnotes he is forced to confront a moral dilemma .

According to the Liberal - Irish alliance , the Irish party was supposed to abstain from the 1901 Conservative bill , aimed at bringing denominational schools in England and Wales into the national education system while at the same time absenting them from local government control : that is , giving finance while maintaining the system of denominational clerical control .

It 's often thought that previous attempts have failed because there are n't enough well - trained classical actors in the USA to make such a repertory company feasible , but this is increasingly not the case : American drama students are eager to train in the UK , and the percentage of successful auditions held is relatively high . In Great Britain the ear becomes accustomed to the native British voice handling the classical text , but this really should not hinder American actors ; they need not become totally accentless in order to @play@ classical verse . Instead they need to find out the rhythms of speech which make the music of the verse work in dramatic form . Many American students working in British drama schools find the answer to this question by using what is called standard American , and this approach is being used now in training on both sides of the Atlantic .

But a residual effect of the privatizing of sexuality , and in particular of the construction of sexual deviance as an identity , a pathology of being , rather than a kind of behaviour in principle open to all , is that the challenge to this construction often itself remains imprisoned by the public/private dichotomy . So while the whole point of the @argument@ , and rightly , is that when gender is understood as culture rather than nature we see that gender is implicated in all aspects of culture , in practice the argument rarely gets oft the bed . As we shall see shortly , the way out of the bedroom is via the wider cultures , rather than the specific sexual acts , of transgressive reinscription for example , the writings of Wilde , Genet , and others , the subculture from which they emerge and help to form and transform . First there is another objection to be considered : do deviant identities and sexualities really denaturalize through theatrical parody as straightforwardly as is sometimes suggested ?

Finally , while it could be argued that Greeley and Rossi tell us something of catholic versus state schooling in the US , they have nothing to tell us about catholic versus Christian , multi - denominational schools , which is what most of the @argument@ in Ireland is about . But the central and substantive argument that defenders of Roman catholic schools have had to deal with is that the dual school system in Northern Ireland encourages , supports , or at least reinforces the sectarian divide , and that it forms part of the vicious circle maintaining conflict in Ulster . It has been argued that one could help to break that circle by integrating the school system ( Fraser 1974 ; Heskin 1980 ) .

Experience of this nature may reduce the reliance of less developed countries on goods imported from abroad ; local manufacturers may be able to satisfy local market needs by intelligent marketing , and thus gain a larger share of the local market than before , with consequent results for local levels of production and the economy generally . A further element in this @argument@ is the possibility that advertising can be used as part of a marketing strategy to shape the wants and needs of a less developed society in a direction that is clearly beneficial . For instance , if a country concerned still employs traditional systems which , in the light of more modern techniques , appear to be detrimental to public health , it may be desirable to change patterns of behaviour in , say , nutrition or hygiene . Often this will not be successful if the population is attached to its traditional methods and the new methods are radically different from the old ; a careful marketing campaign to change attitudes can have a dramatic effect , particularly by presenting new products in a way that is not dramatically different from the old .

But the complement remains forever out of reach and desire thereby becomes , for Lacan , a kind of derangement , with the subject caught in the rails eternally stretching forth towards the desire for something else of metonymy ( Ecrits , 167 ) .

In addition , the clergy appear to have considerable difficulty in recognizing the transformation which theoretical positions on Christian belief and morality undergo as they are concretized in historical human relationships , doubtless also because of the strong essentialist bias in their perception of socio - ethical issues . Part of the overall @argument@ of this book is that , as the Roman catholic church is principal validator or legitimator of the Southern state along with the concept of the national entity , what that state goes on to do in the field of social ethics cannot be separated out from the responsibilities of the church . This structural link between politics and religion is underlined by the legitimacy the church gives to the state as a whole , by recognizing it simply as society . However , it is the further legitimation given to a particular socio - ethical form of political religion in the constitution and to the implied authority of religious intellectuals in deciding in concreto what must be taken by the state as in the interests of the common good which gives to conflict in Ireland between the two alliances its political religious dimension in the sphere of law.

Like Douglas , I see no point in setting up a false theoretical dichotomy between us , and them , creating separate realms and polarities of modern and archaic thought , for I anticipate my inclusion of the concept of self can help link the tribalism which haunts the police defensiveness to an understanding of their modern beliefs , modes of thought , and action . Hopefully this will allow the ethnography to extend on the interpretive analysis which Kuper ( 1973 ) termed neostructural and which has since combined aspects of a feminist , semantic , and symbolic framework to generate what may well be a short - lived disciplinary ism of post - modern anthropology ( Young 1989 ) .

Weston in her from Ritual to Romance , to the effect that the charges of heresy brought against the Templars were not wholly unfounded , since some of the practices of the Eleusinian mystery - cults from the pagan Near East survived in the heart of Christendom in the rituals of the Templars , a survival to be traced in literature in the stories and poems about the quest of the holy grail . From Ritual to Romance came out in 1920 , and was a new book when T.S. Eliot borrowed from it for The Waste Land , thus making it permanently famous ; Pound could not have known of it in 1911 , but if he had then visited the Templars ' cavern - church in Aubeterre he could hardly have failed to remember it in the light of jessie Weston 's @argument@ . Certainly in recent years Pound 's interest in mystery - cults has been more than antiquarian ; in was Erigena ours ? he asks whether the philosopher Scotus Erigena was one of the Eleusinian brotherhood , and ours can be given full weight Noel Stock goes so far as to claim ( op . cit . p.22 ) that some of the obscurity of these later Cantos is deliberate and arcane he writes about them as an initiate in words that are both published and not published .

argument.n 0 0 0 0 1 0 @ So why not say , then , that in development perception teaches action , that as the information delivered up by the input systems becomes progressively richer the infant becomes better able to direct his own movements , rather than saying that cognisance develops out of action ? My answer to this point will be more philosophical than empirical . It will rely upon an @argument@ from Kant . In the Critique of Pure Reason , Kant 's aim was to show how objective experience is possible , to set out the conditions necessary for this ; whilst Piaget 's aim was to show , given certain Kantian assumptions , how objective experience actually develops . One of the conditions for ascribing to oneself experiences of a mind - independent reality , Kant argued , was that we should be capable of distinguishing between those sequences of perceptions ( if you like , representations delivered up by the input systems ) which are determined by the movement of objects and those which are determined by our own movements .

Again , Pound 's admirers will protest ; and they will be right , insofar as Yeats 's account of the Cantos is n't so definitive as Olson takes it to be . But the main thrust of Olson 's @argument@ is unaffected , and it ca n't be set aside : this great American poet ( and Olson knows that Pound is all of that ) was a Fascist , profoundly , and no amount of talk about his affinities with Whitman will save him for democracy , nor will any attempt to treat his anti - Semitism as an unrelated pathological aberration . Another escape hatch that Olson slams shut upon us is the device of distinguishing between Pound - the - man and Pound - the - poet . The trouble with this manoeuvre is that it cannot help but demote poetry .

Despite the @arguments@ in favour of the course which the King adopted , his encouragement to MacDonald to hold the government together and to fight the election as a government had quite momentous consequences for the politics of the 1930s . Although the King 's intentions were not partisan , the consequences were such as to offer very considerable benefit to the Conservative party . The 1931 general election gave the Conservatives a huge overall majority in the House of Commons , enabling them to pursue their tariff policy with little hindrance .

Steiner 's ludicrous generalizations stem in part from the very notion of defining cultures and history in terms of a sensibility .

From Carson to Paisley one finds the @argument@ that it is legitimate to fight to regain one 's fundamental freedom if the sovereign with whom one has covenanted one 's allegiance betrays that allegiance and conducts one into slavery .

Much of our daily work was ten years in advance of the official police community involvement programmes and yet our actions were only an extension of those social welfare activities the police have been heavily involved in for generations , but which are never given status as real police work simply because of the institutional emphasis placed upon summons lists , numbers of arrests , crime detections , and other statistical returns .

Reflection on the nature of the argument against behaviourism in general , however , reveals that the argument refutes the behaviourist treatment of perception in particular . That @argument@ showed that knowledge of the external world cannot be reduced to behavioural dispositions , for the very idea of a disposition functions only in the context of an unreduced grasp on the physical world . But there is nowhere else that we might get our conception of the physical world from , other than perception .

The attempt to enforce an evaluative criticism in the academy inevitably results in rigidity and dogmatism and , ultimately , a form of brainwashing . Leavisites , of course , claimed that they were committed to discussion , argument , the free play of mind ; in so far as they were , it was contained within the enclosing form of life , not directed against it , rather like @arguments@ within Marxist - Leninist ideology . It was this aspect of Leavisism that Oxford English , with its broad though often flaccid eclecticism , was most opposed to . Venturing to propound a law of intellectual life , I suggest that evaluative criticism enters institutional literary study under the influence of practising writers , or of critics who have a close discipular relation to them , but that in time it is rejected , like an alien organ .

But this is just what the physicalist cannot allow . The second and more important point is that the general @argument@ against behaviouristic theories does take in functionalism and is not merely directed against traditional behaviourism : it works against any theory that analyses one 's conception of the world simply in terms of the way one functions that is , behaves in the world . The addition of internal discriminations within the nervous system adds nothing relevant to this , unless the internal discriminations really possessed semantic properties , so that they somehow contained in themselves a real description of the world . But it is accepted by physicalists of all kinds that the meaning or semantic value of internal states must be analysed in terms of their causal relations to stimulus and response , just as it is for the behaviourist 's dispositions , and is not something they possess in their own right , or of themselves .

It has been argued that one could help to break that circle by integrating the school system ( Fraser 1974 ; Heskin 1980 ) . A small number of empirical studies actually done in Northern Ireland have been invoked in the course of the debate .

Police duties in Easton are similar to those in non - divided societies , and the manner in which these tasks are viewed and accomplished parallels that elsewhere .

The justification of Mr Pound 's thesis in How To Read is not his @arguments@ , but his poetry . Leavis , who countered How To Read with a booklet , How to Teach Reading , and Winters , who declared in 1937 , Mr Pound resembles a village loafer who sees much and understands little , told the same story as Tate : Pound was a naf , an imagination and sensory apparatus that consistently performed better than it knew , in ways that the maker 's own discursive intelligence failed to comprehend or measure up to ; in Winters 's memorable and mordant judgement of 1943 , a sensibility without a mind , or with as little mind as is well possible .

His @argument@ is as follows : a man 's masculinity is indeed insecure ; it is an endless trial , a precariously held , endlessly tested , unstable condition ( p. 91 ) . In this it is almost tragic : the unique vulnerability to tailed expectations is the fatal flaw in the masculine ego the testing of masculinity knows no bounds to prove oneself remains a lifelong necessity .

The survey , prepared by the giant reinsurance group Swiss Re , shows that building societies pose a growing threat to insurance companies . In it , 1,500 individuals were asked : If you were to buy life assurance , which of the following methods , if any , would you choose from a salesman in your own home , from a broker in his office , by post ( either from a newspaper advertisement or from a mailshot ) , from a @bank@ , or from a building society . The responses indicated that 28 per cent would prefer to buy through a building society ; 27 per cent said they would buy from a salesman in their own home .

Contrary to declarations that there was no government policy for sterling and that it would be left to the markets to decide , by late 1981 the government intervened to reverse a fall in the exchange rate , and raised base rate to 16 per cent . It did the same again in January 1985 ; when the pound fell to 1.12 @banks@ were instructed to raise interest rates by 1.5 per cent .

This is a phenomenon which most of us experience from time to time , particularly when performing a highly practised task like driving a car or using a keyboard , and which the clinician often feels presents in exaggerated form in certain neurological conditions . The term blindsight was coined by Larry Weiskrantz at Oxford to describe perhaps the best known example of this dissociation , in which patients with damage to the visual areas of the cortex deny being able to see a visual stimulus while behaving in some respects as if they are processing it , for instance by moving their eyes in its direction .

It announced that , if doctrine as opposed to Bible stories was to be a part of school education , then such religious education could not adopt a common denominator approach between the churches , but had to be total in its presentation of what the Roman catholic church considered to be the truth , otherwise such an approach would be dangerous for the children ( Gaine 1968 : 164 ) . The implementation of this policy was the work in part of the new Roman episcopal appointees , from Cullen onwards , though the growing hatred of the ascendancy because of the famine and their continued landownership must have @provided@ ample cause for separate schools for the majority of Roman catholic clergy .

He did not mention that one definition of a composer 's talent is that he can write music that compels an audience 's attention .

Anne Keddy Hector , Robert Seyfarth and Michael Raleigh at the Universities of California and Pennsylvania have been studying parental behaviour among captive vervets to see if males ' parental ability affected the females ' choice of mate .

This double characterisation was made more hilarious at the first performances when the bossy one was danced by Helpmann , and later the taller MacMillan , with wonderfully extended dvelopps , and the shyer one by Ashton with dainty attempts to be correct at all costs . A similar incongruous matching of the very tall girl with one of the shortest boys in MacMillan 's Elite Syncopations reveals that he , too , understands that old music - hall and pantomime practices are a wonderful source of inspiration if a British @audience@ is to laugh and enjoy the occasion as the dancers do .

They do this even though they may break the conventions from time to time . They do it because they know the @audience@ is watching a constantly evolving picture which is being drawn on , over , across and above a flat stage in front of a background . They know they must fill the empty space with movement , whether there is scenery in the background or where the costumes are at their simplest and the background merely a hint of some venue as , for example , in Symphonic Variations or Requiem , or even just shafts of light as in Monotones .

audience.n 0 0 1 0 0 @ The way it works is this : Shaw Taylor introduces three short scenes in which actors have rows , go to industrial tribunals , issue death threats and so forth . If necessary , Shaw then adds details ( who sued whom ) , and a panel of celebrities is asked who won and why , or who got sent down and for how long . The Law Game suffers uniquely by its @audience@ : you know that they are there , because they applaud at the beginning . But after that , every joke belly - flops into silence . Well , almost every joke : when celebrity panellist Duggie Brown said backside , how they roared !
audience.n 0 0 1 0 0 @ Despite the general activities there is menace in the air and it is not long before the rival factions of Montagues and Capulets are fighting and deaths occurring before the lovers even meet . This opening is very different from the quietly charming first scene of A Month in the Country , where the only thing amiss is Natalia 's bored behaviour . Even with such examples in mind the choreographer may well decide it is better to delay the confrontation between the chief players because , by creating and stressing the general atmosphere , this raises the @audience@ 's expectations before the meeting of the protagonists , and the sudden onset of passion is what makes the ultimate tragedy so poignant . This happens in Giselle where Hilarion 's suspicions of Albrecht 's identity are already aroused before Albrecht meets Giselle . Hilarion 's discovery of Albrecht 's sword and later his confrontation with Giselle , with the sword in his hands , still does not convince Giselle of Albrecht 's duplicity .

Underlying these themes was the belief that the problems of the British system were being thrown into stark relief by the endless economic difficulties of the 1970s . The Oxford economists , Bacon and Eltis , found a receptive @audience@ across the political spectrum for their diagnosis that Britain was generating far too few producers of wealth . In their stead came a new intermediate breed of service operatives working in administration , in finance , or in the professions .

Although this is of considerable importance , particularly if the ballet is to be presented in a large theatre , too much concentration on certain of the dimensions ( height , depth or breadth ) may deprive some members of the @audience@ of much of the pattern . for example , too much weaving and rolling of bodies on the floor is hardly visible from the stalls , whilst too much concentration on one side of the stage finds spectators on the same side craning their necks to see what is going on . It was for such reason that most of Petipa 's famous pas de deux take place centre stage , whilst those of Ashton and MacMillan cover the whole area as befits their more flowing lyrical styles ,

These are the full stops to a paragraph that give the @audience@ an opportunity to sum up as it were how the Bride 's hair is cut ; why the men convey the Groom to the Bride 's house ; how the Bride and Groom are blessed by their parents ; and so on . By so phrasing each paragraph and bringing each incident to a proper conclusion , Nijinska gives both dancers and audience time to consider what has been done and what is yet to happen .

The actress Jane Asher , author of books on really sticky cakes , asked the @audience@ to boycott Nescafe when she accepted the consumer section award on behalf of the Baby Milk Action Coalition , which has criticised the Swiss giant for selling milk substitutes to third world babes .

Thus the @audience@ fail to understand everything that is offered . Dance is firstly a physical activity and if it is obscured by complicated costumes , props , machinery , lighting and stage effects , it ceases to be relevant to anything but the cleverness of the producer .

But there is not much Pinter , and definitely no Beckett , about this solid piece of middle - class music theatre by the Canadian composer Quenten Doolittle , which began its short British tour by the Banff Music Theatre at the Chapter Arts Centre , Cardiff . Doolittle has based himself on what seems a pellucidly consequential and intelligently written play by Rex Deverell ( also the librettist ) ; and though the piece is offered as best suited to alternative @audiences@ , it cuts an oddly respectable figure in the modestly louche surroundings of Chapter . Two reasons strike me for this . First , the work is dramaturgically polite ; it consults its audience too much to be taken seriously as drop - out theatre .

He insisted that his dancers told their own story by using the many conventional gestures familiar to theatregoers throughout Europe . He explained the gestures in the libretto he prepared for his @audience@ . As a Greek and Latin scholar he had found them described in the works of ancient authors who wrote about the moods , emotions and actions of all the actors involved in their dramas . By 1717 these gestures were accepted practice by actors to reinforce the meaning of the words spoken and particularly by members of the commedia dell'arte travelling troupes who produced mime plays .
audience.n 0 0 0 0 1 @ Any rule directly or indirectly restricting solicitors ' freedom to undertake all the actions necessary for the preparation and presentation of cases will need the approval of both the Secretary of State and the Lord President of the Court of Session . But in what the Law Society also interpreted yesterday as a clear shift in emphasis from the English proposals , the paper makes it clear that the role of the Lord President would be no different from the one he currently exercises when approving training and professional rules . Under the English White Paper , rights of @audience@ rules drawn up by the Law Society in conjunction with an advisory committee will be subject to the concurrence of four senior judges . The society fears that the Bar and judges will exert subtle pressure to build in case separation requirements . The Master of the Rolls , Lord Donaldson , one of the four , told barristers recently that the interests of justice might require preparation and presentation of criminal , matrimonial and judicial review cases to be in separate hands .

Thus battle has been joined between RAI and the private channels for an @audience@ which Italian advertisers regard as pre - eminently desirable .

In other words he opened up the circles , squares and longways sets to show what gave rhythm and life to the movements .

The Labour Party 's lead in the polls and the doubts which the Conservatives themselves cannot help feeling about the state of the economy , both made the audience in the Winter Gardens anxious to demonstrate unity by giving standing ovations to the architects of the Government 's economic policy .

Many plotless or so - called abstract ballets , by choreographers such as Balanchine , have no specific characters or climaxes but they do follow the composer 's score very closely .

RAI protests that this amounts to a colossal waste of money since it previously acquired Eurovision rights for nothing more than the duty of reciprocal access to material from Italy . But the pickings could be huge : the @audience@ for RAI 's recorded Italian Sunday football in the United States and Canada may be as high as 50 million , while down in Latin America they hunger for footage of Maradona at almost any price . Berlusconi , unabashed by his own creation of what amounts to a duopoly , bangs the drum of the free market against RAI , claiming that the licence payers ' money is being squandered to break down unwanted competition . The Director - General , Biagio Agnes ( like all RAI executives a political party appointee ) , has angrily accused the Berlusconi camp of dragging in even the authorities of the state and seizing every opportunity to attack the public broadcasting service with statements of such arrogance that they betray weakness and sheer lack of class despite ( Berlusconi 's ) economic power and much - vaunted influential friendships .

audience.n 0 0 1 0 0 @ By JOHN POPE UNNATURAL troubles , in John Pope 's extraordinary production , dominate the stage long before any unnatural deeds by Macbeth himself . Hecate immediately warns the @audience@ , in a speech displaced to the opening , that it is confronted by a chaotic world in which Scotland does not even stand where it did . Some Armageddon has wiped away landscape and locale , leaving only a hurricane - stricken desolation , blasted by a huge wind - machine on the stage . Nature , we learn , has long since sickened and died .

But it was part of a performance by one of the contenders for the Ninth National Review of Live Art . Needless to say , that artist was not selected by Nikki Milican the festival 's director who attended hundreds of events up and down the country .
audience.n 0 0 1 0 0 @ His Firebird flew and still flies in all her glory before being trapped pitifully in the arms of the Tsarevich . Her release sends her soaring in grands jets en avant through the magic garden . This flight of the magic bird held and stili holds @audiences@ spellbound . Ashton 's version of La Fille Mal Garde is a perfect twentieth - century example of demi - caractre ballet . So are de Valois ' The Rake 's Progress , Cranko 's Pineapple Poll and Robbins ' The Concert .
audience.n 0 0 1 0 0 @ Hoskyns , said one of the astringent colleagues who disapproved of him , went to Berlin and they muddled his mind and when he came back he could never get it unmuddled . Hoskyns was not a good lecturer . At least , he lectured in such a way that many in the @audience@ found him impossible to understand . This was one of the reasons why Bethune - Baker , who thought that everything obscure was woolly , regarded him as useless if not bad for the young . Students were known to spend their time in his lectures counting up the number of clichs which he used .
audience.n 0 0 1 0 0 @ A contradiction in style during this change of aulement or alignment can distort the design . Nevertheless an unusual change of aulement or alignment can add interest and draw attention to a dancer 's statement . for example : the swift change from the grand dvelopp la seconde which Odile makes facing the @audience@ and her sudden turn to arabesque when she looks straight into the kneeling Siegfried 's eyes in the Act II pas de deux of Swan Lake ; it is Odile 's triumph for she knows she has won Siegfried 's heart . Even more exciting changes of aulement can be found in Ashton 's Birthday Offering where each soloist dances an old step at a new angle , without breaking the rules or older conventions of nineteenth - century ballet . He then gives an entirely new quality to the class - room exercise on which these enchanements are based.
audience.n 0 0 1 0 0 @ The Association is most grateful to the AOC Air Cadets and the Director of the Girls Venture Corps for permitting their respective Corps to provide this much appreaciated help . Cinema Industry Even though the long , hot summer took its toll on @audiences@ , the generous support of Cannon Cinemas still provided the Association with the substantial sum of 88,358 . In addition , this company also contributed to the Association 's efforts on behalf of the Reach for the Sky Appeal by helping to arrange a Royal Film Gala night at their Shaftsbury Avenue cinema . The film of the Douglas Bader story Reach for the Sky was shown on the big screen for the first time in many years , and the Association was able to contribute 20,200 to the RAF Benevolent Fund as a result of this effort .
audience.n 0 0 0 1 0 @ Piecemeal highlights are all very well , but viewers tend to be creatures of habit and , at present , a short burst of goals every Saturday night is just a tease ; an uninitiated visitor would never guess that football was the national game . Within ITV 's ranks , there is concern that last season 's gains have been wasted . The overlord Greg Dyke , having paid a minimum of 11m a year for exclusive rights to the League ( at the current rate of inflation , the four - year , index - linked bill could soar over 50m ) , hit his @audience@ target of eight million when Manchester United beat Liverpool thrillingly on New Year 's Day . Then came Arsenal 's unforgettable finale at Anfield in May , watched by nearly 12 million people ( more than the BBC got for the FA Cup final ) . The viewers were hungry , one member of staff said .
audience.n 0 0 0 1 0 @ We need to distinguish between different elements of the media , and between the media 's ability to inform and its ability to persuade . In this chapter we have looked at influences on public perceptions of politics , not at influences upon attitudes . From what we already knew about its @audiences@ and programme content , we expected that television would have a stronger influence on public information and perceptions than on public attitudes and choices ; while the press , particularly the mass - selling tabloids , would have a stronger influence on public attitudes and choices than on public information and perceptions . Television news was pervasive , undifferentiated , and relatively unbiased . It proved immensely effective at communicating party campaign themes to the electorate , but in the short span of an election campaign it had only a small influence on the public 's issue - agenda .
audience.n 0 0 0 1 0 @ This is as unsatisfactory as reading about a picture which is not illustrated . The crux of a personality article is that it aims to satisfy a reader 's curiosity . An editor 's directions to the writer of an article may be to take a populist approach , suitable for a wide @audience@ . The article written to this brief is likely to have an element of sensationalism ; curiosity about sex or money may be deliberately aroused ; conflicts in an artist 's life are likely to be dramatised . An amusing parallel in the film business is an account given by the director Ken Russell of how he sold the idea of making a film about Tchaikowsky ; he described it to his potential backers as the story of a homosexual who fell in love with a nymphomaniac .
audience.n 0 0 0 1 0 @ What we were offered , if definition is needed , might be called ballet - pantomime : it was certainly not opera . As in the best ballet - pantomimes , the message is direct in origin and presentation . At times the method is decidedly crude , especially in a hint of West Side Story which concludes the overture , doubtless aimed at today 's @audience@ . Oddly enough , Ghanashyam ( A Broken Branch ) approaches opera in the nature of the story it tells : originating in village festivities , the tale unfolds a rake 's progress towards perdition , in this case via drugs , but with an extra metaphysical twist when the spirit of the departed returns to inhabit his wife . While the intentions of the plot are clear enough , it is not significantly developed by the dance .
audience.n 0 0 1 1 0 @ Yet the above ballets are different again from de Valois ' The Rake 's Progress , which was based on the reality of Hogarth 's pictures . When these pictures were issued they were indeed contemporary because they were based on the evils of the day . Today 's @audiences@ find them old - fashioned : yet many modern ballets deal with similar evils such as present - day problems with drugs , AIDS , mental handicap , racism , imprisonment and so on , in which the balletic interpretation makes the same impression if the choreographer has really studied the themes outlined in his subject . These choreographers must create movements which display each protagonist 's particular behaviour and reactions . Too often their movements are insufficiently defined because too much effort is made to shock , unlike the tightly controlled movements of characters in The Rake 's Progress and A Distant Drummer .
audience.n 0 0 0 1 0 @ All the signs are that radio is an exciting prospect the forthcoming deregulation of the industry with associated changes in costs , and an expected boom in advertising revenues , is finally making the City take notice . The potential for an advertising bonanza has come under the spotlight with the advent of splitting frequencies such as that undertaken by London 's LBC last week . Splitting frequencies transmitting different programmes on FM and AM could effectively double listening hours and provides two highly targeted @audiences@ for advertising in a catchment area . In LBC 's case , for example , the LBC Crown FM is going for the upmarket listener , while the medium wave service , London Talkback Radio , is pitching for the tabloid market and the dedicated followers of phone - ins . Capital Radio , the other UK giant of the independents , has already split its frequencies , and before long all nine quoted independent stations are expected do so , albeit not always around the clock .
audience.n 0 0 1 0 0 @ Before a demoralising defeat when challenging Mike Tyson for the world heavyweight championship two years ago Biggs would have probably been too dangerous a proposition for Mason but something has gone from him since then and he was unable to fulfil bold pre - fight assertions . Both men took heavy blows and by withstanding the best of the American 's punches Mason at least emphasised that he has a strong enough chin . It was not a contest to excite the @audience@ and there must have been some anxiety in Mason 's corner as it approached a critical stage . Mason was ahead but Biggs for a while looked the stronger man and employed his superior technique to suggest that Mason might be running into trouble . He took four of six rounds and yet without ever making his supporters believe that a decisive victory was on the cards .
audience.n 1 0 0 0 0 @ When the research is carried out by academics from outside , critical analysis creates enormous tensions . Barrie Irving , director of the Police Foundation , indicated this antipathy in his title to a paper given to the British Psychological Society , Research into Policy wo n't go ( 1983 ) . He told his @audience@ that C.I.D . officers use deception , trickery and psychologically oriented persuasive tactics amounting to threats and inducements , in order to obtain confessions ; and this process is potentiated by the custodial environment . Of course , insiders are well aware of the drama which surrounds interrogation and do not need to be reminded or really welcome such information being made public , for as a detective colleague pointed out after reading Irving 's paper , if we do n't use fear , force , fraud or the promise , how do they think we are going to clear up the crime and get the coughs the system needs to survive ?
audience.n 0 0 1 0 0 @ Yet Ashton found ways of so moulding classical dance that the ladies even danced sur les pointes in so Edwardian a setting . The ballet could have been entered under the title of demi - caractre , but those people were not figments of the imagination . They really lived , were visualised by the composer , then the choreographer and recognised by old friends in the @audience@ . Robbins Dances at a Gathering could be called a romantic ballet because it uses classical technique coloured by natural emotional expression . It communicates the moods , sentiments and behaviour of young people meeting to enjoy each other 's company as young people always do though not usually to Chopin 's romantic music .
audience.n 0 0 1 0 0 @ As explained elsewhere classical technique is the most demanding . It has evolved from the simplest folk through the mannered court and finally to the expert classical dance . It is designed to display both dancer and dance to the best advantage from the @audience@ 's point of view . It is a strict discipline upon which to build . Its exponents are trained to feel how to move with each part of their bodies and to know how their movements must be coordinated to produce one or another step or pose .

All have been translated into successful choreographic form . Similarly the delicate and subtle nuances of such ballets as Ashton 's A Month in the Country , Robbins ' Dances at a Gathering and MacMillan 's Song of the Earth are successfully conveyed and capture the @audience@ 's attention from the moment the curtain rises by the impetus , rhythm , dimension and variety of dance . Dance in all its aspects has proved capable of embracing the whole range of emotions and behaviour that emerge from a proper reading and understanding of the text . Mass

audience.n 0 0 1 1 0 @ Certainly the new actor should never remain idle but create chances wherever possible . This may sound like cold comfort when you 're desperately hoping for something to come along and get you going but continuing your work and maintaining skills is vitally important . Above all you need new @audience@ experience now you are out of drama school . And , although nobody wishes to be exploited with low wages and very difficult conditions , it is frankly better to find the ways and means of presenting yourself somehow , than not perform at all . The new actor is generally operating in top gear and if this momentum is stopped it can be very damaging to the morale and can result in an actor 's technical skills going rusty something to be avoided at all costs .

audience.n 0 0 1 0 0 @ Not a madly promising menu , and fraught with predictable dangers . Compared with the mysteries surrounding the deaths of President Kennedy or Marilyn Monroe , the controversy surrounding Spandau 's 93 - year - old inmate is about as interesting as the fall of a dead leaf . And dispersing the @audience@ 's attention among nine separate TV sets is a sure way of dispersing any atmosphere you may have been lucky enough to set up. In the event 90 minutes without an interval it quickly became clear that all the surveillance in the house would be cruelly trained on those unfortunates doomed to flesh out Brenton 's thoughts . The plot , insofar as one could discern it , was both labyrinthine and self - cancellingly ambiguous , built round an interview in a psychiatric hospital between a journalist and the grief - obsessed widow of a German professor who had bequeathed a videotape casting doubt on the official version of Hess 's death .
audience.n 0 0 1 1 0 @ Definite confirmation of ITV 's withdrawal from the fixture can be expected today . This First Division match , always one of the most emotional , fiercely fought contests of the season , was originally scheduled for last Saturday . As this date did not come within ITV 's planned winter programme of Sunday afternoon games a new date was proposed , December 22 , a Friday night with a kick - off at 8.05 , prime - time viewing guaranteed to capture a huge @audience@ in holiday mood . Neither club was pleased , supporters were furious and Liverpool were reported to have protested strongly . There was much concern expressed on Merseyside about the safety aspects of a match kicking off that late in the evening on the day when all the tradtional pre - Christmas parties are held in offices and factories .

The White Paper on changes to the Scottish legal profession published yesterday by Malcolm Rifkind , the Secretary of State for Scotland , says that once trained , Scottish solicitors should have unrestricted rights of audience in the higher courts , with the standard of performance achieved in training as the sole test . Any rule directly or indirectly restricting solicitors ' freedom to undertake all the actions necessary for the preparation and presentation of cases will need the approval of both the Secretary of State and the Lord President of the Court of Session .

By 1717 these gestures were accepted practice by actors to reinforce the meaning of the words spoken and particularly by members of the commedia dell'arte travelling troupes who produced mime plays . In these the expert gestures and extemporised playing of easily recognised characters in certain stock situations were understood by @audiences@ everywhere no matter what the native language because the gestures were so explicit . These gestures were first listed by monks in the tenth century . They described some four hundred used by monks and nuns of certain religious orders during the hours of silence .
audience.n 0 0 1 0 0 @ This knowledge is also recursive , in that the competent policeman or woman needs to know which criminals have a common - sense knowledge about the activities and deployment of the police , which requires that they have the additional common sense to confound the criminal 's working knowledge of the police . Hence a policeman is only as good as his interest in his and surrounding areas ( FN 30/11/87 , p. 28 ) . The field - worker was a captive @audience@ to whom members of the force could display their competence when riding around Easton in a police vehicle , and conversations were punctuated by policemen pointing out significant sites and personnel . So , too , were new recruits and staff transferred from outside the area . However , the dissemination of this knowledge to newcomers has the additional purpose of inculcating in them the common sense that is necessary to police Easton .
audience.n 0 0 1 1 0 @ Robert Saxton , in these pages , recently denied that there was any longer a problem with contemporary music , and instead lectured the audience about paying closer attention . He did not mention that one definition of a composer 's talent is that he can write music that compels an audience 's attention . If the Orphic myth defines the power of music , it is because Orpheus compelled an entirely hostile @audience@ to listen to him. Mr Saxton also dismissed the idea of music as entertainment . ENO , I am glad to say , is proud to be dismissed by him to the purgatory reserved for this despicable activity , and more than 450,000 people pass through our doors each year to prove it .
audience.n 0 0 1 0 0 @ This can be effected by the use of a leitmotif or phrases of music . Since the first performance of Giselle , certain composers and arrangers have used leitmotifs fur one or several characters and repeat the leitmotifs each time the characters appear . These musical phrases give continuity to the action and are most valuable because they help both performers and @audience@ to understand how moments in the story or theme affect the players . Adolphe Adam , composer of the music for Giselle , initiated this idea which greatly influenced Wagner and later composers . Leitmotifs are a firm point of reference that carries the dancer onwards from the beginning to the climax and to the end of the story .

It might require public subsidies to political parties to finance their own newspapers and television stations . Alternatively , rival parties could be given control of different public television stations : so BBC 1 and Channel 4 might become conservative - right wing channels while BBC 2 and ITV become socialist - left wing channels , which could then compete for an @audience@ . The situation in some European countries approximates that model . In Britain the idea of openly partisan broadcasting was pioneered by the Scottish Nationalists ' clandestine and illegal Radio Free Scotland in the 1960s and more recently by Southern Sound , who used a discarded former commercial radio band to set up their entirely open and legal Conference Radio FM to cover the 1990 Conservative Party Conference from an unashamedly pro - Conservative viewpoint .

The Women in Film group will produce a session with particular emphasis on Women as Audience and the Representation of Women in Sport . Sport and the coverage of sport on television is a major part of the everyday life of the television @audience@ .

He did not write an autobiography , but his letters have been a source of fascination to a wide @audience@ , especially artists . Luckily , he had a correspondent in his brother Theo in whom he could confide and with whom he could explore ideas about art ; the letters are thus an invaluable source of interpretation . From the distance of a century , some of Van Gogh 's enthusiastic appraisals of the art of his time look curious ; but then , this artist acting as a critic was especially vulnerable to admiring art with a moral purpose , or work from which he was able to draw inspiration .

She greeted her son with a nod and relief that Bunty had lagged behind on the stairs , giggling with some others . Not a good @audience@ , she declared from behind the screen as Jessie helped her out of her dress , Typical matinee .

audience.n 0 0 1 0 0 @ Doolittle has based himself on what seems a pellucidly consequential and intelligently written play by Rex Deverell ( also the librettist ) ; and though the piece is offered as best suited to alternative audiences , it cuts an oddly respectable figure in the modestly louche surroundings of Chapter . Two reasons strike me for this . First , the work is dramaturgically polite ; it consults its @audience@ too much to be taken seriously as drop - out theatre . And secondly , its music is too operatic too Brittenesque to excite us searching spirits who trek through gaslit suburbs in quest of aesthetic deprivation . Like the artists in La Boheme , Aggie and Sprugg Deverell 's two winos - spend a good deal of time play - acting , in an operative sort of way .
audience.n 0 0 1 0 0 @ This can be easily recognised if Bizet 's music for Carmen is compared with De Falla 's fur The Three - Cornered Hat . Yet the former has sufficient Spanish flavour , as does the Minkus score fur Don Quixote , for audiences to believe that characters really would perform in the way they do to the kind of music provided . When Dauberval removed to Bordeaux , the @audience@ , like those elsewhere in france , was largely unaware of the grandeur of aristocratic entertainment . It welcomed the new ideas in La Fille Mal Garde because the characters portrayed were familiar and were living in the farms and vineyards . Dauberval is said to have borrowed steps and gestures from such people to give his ballet greater reality .

Leo McKern has some fun answering frequent calls of nature and waving a huge condom around , but he 's doing no more or less than passing the time until the phoney climax of the First Act curtain , by which time you 're aware that as a play Boswell is a fraud . Will delight fans of Boswell and Rumpole alike , claims one critic , but it 's McKern 's TV incarnation which is the draw , and such @audience@ involvement as exists is not with Edgeworth 's text but with the actor 's genial clowning .

audience.n 0 0 0 1 0 @ The variations and exceptions to these brief generalised statements can be found in a number of books , some by investigative outsiders , some in memoirs by dealers and others interested in the market . For other periods , historians are slowly making studies which document the connections of critics and historians with the markets . In 1959 Dore Ashton was dismissed by the New York Times , the charges being that her articles were not aimed at a wide newspaper @audience@ , and her articles on work by artist friends gave evidence of bias ( her husband , whose work she was forbidden to review , was a painter and print - maker called Adja Yunkers ) . John Canaday , the incoming editor of the newspaper 's art page and responsible for the dismissal , had made a challenge to a climate of opinion in which Dore Ashton 's criticism was valued for its sensitivity , and where the art which she praised was accepted . Her supporters included Thomas Hess , Meyer Schapiro , Leo Steinberg , Harold Rosenberg , and Peter Selz , and their intervention , asserting that Canaday had offended Ashton 's rights and responsibilities as a critic , resulted in Canaday 's being censured by the American art critics ' association .

Some recent work on green vervet monkeys shows that audience effects can be important in other contexts in which their functional significance is a little easier to identify .

audience.n 0 0 0 1 0 @ Amongst the most important of these carefully plotted works are : de Falla 's The Three - Cornered Hat ( 1919 ) which originally accompanied a mime play and so fascinated Diaghilev that he commissioned the composer to enlarge it for Massine 's ballet ( see page 59 ) ; Vaughan William 's Job , commissioned by Diaghilev , was unused until de Valois created her important Masque for Dancing ( 1931 ) ( this marked the inaugural performance of what has become The Royal Ballet ) ; Arthur Bliss ' Checkmate ( 1937 ) was choreographed by de Valois after both composer and choreographer had worked on the plot ; Prokofiev 's Romeo and Juliet was composed with the help of a Shakespearean theatre expert and has been used notably by Lavrovsky , Ashton and MacMillan ( see page 26 ) ; and Ashton provided a roughly outlined plot for Hans Werner Henze 's score for Ondine ( 1958 ) . But standing out above all are the scores commissioned from Stravinsky by Balanchine , such as Apollo , Orpheus and Card Game .

Ken Livingstone 's problem is that he is always on the television slagging the @party@ off .

Since the work of S. S.

As we can now see , the displacing of the linear and quasi - geometrical as the dominant mode in New York ( and Parisian ) abstract art after 1943 offers another instance of that cyclical alternation of non - painterly , or linear , and painterly which has marked the evolution of Western art since the sixteenth century .

remain.v 0 1 0 0 @ O'Carroll sees such positions exemplified by the protagonists ' refusal to accept that certain therapeutic abortions already permitted in Ireland were actually abortions and by their predictions of social chaos should they fail in their fight : Hence phrases such as the opening of the floodgates , the thin end of the wedge , the slippery slope , the permissive society , and the abortion mentality ( 1983 : 12 ) . It is important to point out that these expressions which interpret Irish social reality and events are also used by the high clergy . They are thus not simply a mentality derived from popular religion but from a traditional Roman catholicism which held sway in catholic Europe from the post - Reformation period and @remained@ unchallenged until the 1960s . As will be seen in Chapter 5 , understanding this religious social consciousness requires some grasp of the traditional catholic teaching on the natural order and the good society , and how the nation is to respect the divine order established by God . An example of this can be taken from the recent contraception controversy in the Republic , which began in the 1960s .

As Gibbon has noted , the cases of both Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism remain the two most spectacular class alliances in the political history of the British Isles ( 1975 : 3 ) .

I believe the denial of the PSI report and the furore it caused occurred precisely because it managed to get beneath the surface of police culture to explore the deep structures of belief and to comment adversely about their influence on police activities . The invisibility in the written record , which Shapland and Hobbs ( 1989 ) observed , and the unrecorded information which Chatterton told the conference @remained@ hidden in the heads of the constables are the result of cultural values , which are then brought to bear to deny validity to these agendas . It is worth noting the language in the Federation rebuttal of the PSI report , for it illustrates how the culture is programmed to sneer at the graphic literary phrase and dismiss the use of anecdotal material as unscientific : while participant observation is considered to be a world away from research based on safe academic principles ( my emphasis ) .

remain.v 0 1 0 0 @ Since this condemnation of research opportunity , few studies have penetrated deeply beneath the sensitive skin of police culture , and even though Chatterton in his notes to my thesis argued there has been a considerable amount of participant police research , I would question whether many of these inquiries achieved the finer grain and detail ' of the insider 's account , for they can never really know or tell if they have been excluded from the inner workings of police practice or prevented from gaining access to the hidden realities contained inside the heads of the constables . Because of the litism which such an organization of control wields , it is not surprising there is difficulty in incorporating the outside researcher , or in accepting his critical findings . And certainly that other main arm of executive control the army seems little better at this than the police , for the number of participant accounts of their deep structures @remains@ negligible , supporting McCabe 's ( 1980 ) contention that we should be asking of all of these costly institutions , who is to be controlled by whom and for what reasons ? Meanwhile , as Reiner ( 1985 ) suggests , the politicization of the police has proceeded at a pace , and can be illustrated by their growing willingness to respond to political dissent as a form of crime or deviancy . This trend is further displayed in their growing tendency to agree to be used as a pseudo - military arm of government in its socio - economic and industrial/political disputes with whole sections of society .

Certainly it became economic to pay recording artists large fees ; and without mass - production , few recordings of top artists would survive in playable form today . 7 A Berliner Gramophone .
disc.n 0 0 1 0 0 @ None of these unbreakable records succeeded in displacing shellac . Actually , shellac was perhaps the least important constituent ; the most important was slate dust , whose abrasive and gritty properties were needed for a rather unusual reason . As we saw earlier , @discs@ permitted simple and cheap record - players ; but the advantage was lost if the record - players had to have sapphire or diamond points made out of precious gems . So steel needles were often used instead . To make the needle fit the groove , the disc contained abrasive material , so the tip would be ground down during the first two or three revolutions .

Thomas Edison saw that the public were deserting cylinder records for discs , so he announced his Diamond Disc Phonograph in 1911 , although it was not ready until 1913 . The new @discs@ were also hill - and - dale , recorded with a relatively fine groove - pitch of 150 lines per inch , so a ten - inch side played rather longer than usual ( about five minutes ) . The grooves were U - bottomed with a radius of precisely 4.7 thousandths of an inch , and his reproducers were fitted with the very first diamond styli , of exactly this size for minimum wear and surface - noise . But the grooves were very shallow by normal disc standards , and to reduce the chances of the stylus being thrown out of the groove , the records were made absolutely flat , and a full quarter of an inch thick so they would be sure to stay that way .

The conventional paper label was never possible on a cylinder , since there was insufficient flat space . The end of the cylinder box had to suffice ( 27 ) , and paper labels were not attached to @discs@ until 1901 ( 28 , left ) . It should be pointed out that they were nearly always pressed into the disc at the time of manufacture , not pasted on afterwards ; so the paper and inks had to be able to withstand high temperatures .

In a letter to the Irish premier in 1947 , while an extensive health bill was going through parliament , the bishops pointed out that to claim such powers for the public authority , without qualification , is entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teaching on the rights of the family , the Church in education , the rights of the medical profession and voluntary institutions ( Irish Independent , 12 Apr. 1951 , quoted Whyte 1980 : 143 ) .

There @appears@ to be no creative public vision which will help the survival of the pub or help ensure a healthy and varied pub stock .

To explain the nature of legal change Stone offers a model that suggests first , that clients revealed the gap between current values and the law ; second , that this was followed by the attempt of lawyers and judges to narrow the gap , often by inventing legal fictions or effectively changing the law by judicial re - interpretation ( the changing definition of legal cruelty provides one example of this ) ; and third , that all this culminated eventually in legal change when the level of duplicity and hypocrisy became intolerable to law lords and legislators alike ( pp. 1920 ) . This model , which echoes that used by Oliver MacDonagh to explain the growth in nineteenth century government , relies on a high @degree@ of consonance in the wishes of lawyers and their clients , a not unreasonable assumption given the limited access to divorce in Stone 's period . But it is not a model that holds up for the twentieth century , when liberalization of the divorce law was not a matter of last resort but was rather always proposed as a means of strengthening the institution of marriage ( by permitting those living in sin to remarry ) ; when opinion shifted with dramatic speed , for example between the conservative recommendations of the 1956 Royal Commission on Divorce and the endorsement of profound liberalization given a mere ten years later by both the Law Commission and the Church of England ; and when the change in views of key institutions such as the Church of England were as important as those of lawyers .

He interrupted his cricketing career to go to Cambridge , whom he captained , and then Nottingham University to take a @degree@ in business studies , playing for the county from 1966 to Deryck Murray , fresh from the shower , celebrates his seven victims in the Headingley Test of 1976 . 1969 while he was there .
degree.n 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 @ In large sections of Punjab they extort money ( calling it taxation ) , hold courts , decree what local newspapers should print and even decide what dress schoolchildren should wear . Hindus have long fled the rural parts of Punjab ; now some Sikhs are joining the exodus , disgusted by terrorist excesses that led to 3,787 deaths last year and about 1,500 so far this year . The militants are split between @degrees@ of intransigence , which could make them vulnerable at the polls . Some have called for a boycott of the elections , but most are likely to back the faction of the Akali Dal , the Sikh political party , led by a former police officer , Simranjit Singh Mann . Mr Mann insists that Punjab must be a homeland for the Sikhs , brought into being by a UN - supervised plebiscite .

Britain 's leading wave - jumping event , in its fourth year , is staged in Tiree because the swells most resemble Hawaii 's .

degree.n 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 @ He had aimed to go to Cambridge to read geography , but failed the Latin entrance examination it was necessary to take in those days. In the event , he was accepted at Birmingham University , but just before he arrived he was informed that the geography department had been closed down because of austerity measures brought in during World War N. He therefore decided to read geology instead , but shortly afterwards he received notification that this department was also to be closed . The next best option was to take a BSc @degree@ in coal - mining and that was how he ended up becoming a mining engineer instead of a teacher , which in all probability is the career he would have followed if he had managed to fulfil his original goal of studying geography . Forty years later , after an enormously varied industrial career that has seen Haslam running a diverse range of businesses and involved in a wide variety of functions , from selling to personnel , events have turned full circle . His early days underground working alongside miners on the coal - face have imbued him with a special rapport with the thousands of miners he now oversees as chairman of British Coal .
degree.n 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ Predictably , it shot to the top of the dinner party list of mandatory topics and was talked relentlessly into the ground on every conceivable broadcasting medium . Never has so much explicit description of the mechanics of intercourse been rivetingly televised with such unimpeachable justification . Six months or so of this produced not only a @degree@ of understandable tedium - even the most terrifying things can become boring if lived with long enough but what I would call an inverse effect . Out of sheer perversity , the thinking human seems impelled to say something contrary to whatever received opinion has been yelling at him. Hence , the spate of was - the - risk - exaggerated , debunking stories .

degree.n 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 @ He renegotiated the agreement over tunnel usage by the railways and succeeded in presenting it as a breakthrough . And he made a number of management changes which reinforced the impression that Eurotunnel had become a company capable of acting in the best interests of bankers and shareholders and standing up to the demands of the Anglo - French contracting consortium . Yet , despite numerous rows with the contractors , he has failed so far to tinker with the construction contract to any meaningful @degree@ . It is this contract , which Mr Morton inherited when he joined Eurotunnel , that lies at the heart of present difficulties . Mr Morton needs to bring the contractors down from their revised cost forecast of 7.5bn .
degree.n 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 @ Indeed , the fact that he had apparently used an editor from a Manchester newspaper for some of his purposes was latched onto and quoted as a sign that he was suspect and disloyal . One consequence of these modes of thought is that the service has to live out a continuous and enormous paradox . Even at the same time as it publicly commends higher education , seeking out the graduate entrant , spending large sums on publicity to this end , and funding access to @degree@ courses on scholarships , it also holds to a central ethic of distrust of the academic . Whitaker ( 1979 : 229 ) clearly understands the way this rejection of training and education operates within the service : at present good recruits often have to be chased to Bramshill on the lengthy command courses , because chief constables are not anxious to spare able men , and officers themselves are reluctant to be separated from their families and homes , as well as having a fear that they might lose from being out of sight , out of mind for promotion .
degree.n 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ The 2.5 - litre 90deg six , which was recently shown at Detroit 's Society of Engineers show , produces a hefty 7500rpm and 184lb ft of torque at 5000rpm . The all - alloy 24 - valve twin - cam engine is described by Cosworth as being of the high - efficiency type , and follows the modular theory meaning that the basic design could suit anything from the three - cylinder unit to a V12 . Using its patented Low Pressure Casting technique , Cosworth has been able to incorporate a high @degree@ of stiffness in the compact unit . As a result , it will be suitable for both longitudinal or transverse settings , and can sit low in a chassis . No manufacturer has yet committed itself to using the Cosworth engine , which is expected to be fully ready for production by June.
degree.n 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 @ Pope John Paul , in his encyclical Sollicitudo Rei Socialis , has repudiated not only Marxism but the so - called civilisation of consumerism as destructive of true humanity , substituting having for being , and rooted in structural oppression of the poor . This is not to propose Christianity as a counter - ideology . There can be no Christian blueprint for the final form of society , since it is part of its perception of the human condition that all forms of society are provisional , reflecting human sinfulness , though not always to an equal @degree@ . It does , however , have a missionary vision of what it means to be truly human , derived partly from rational reflection on human capacities and desires , but supremely from its conviction that we glimpse true humanity in the life , death and teaching of Jesus . Both Liberation theologians and the policy - makers of the Vatican are agreed that , measured by the pattern of self - giving love revealed in that life , Western consumerism offers a perverted account of humanity .
degree.n 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 @ If Cultural Studies goes its own way , what happens to what is left ? I would certainly not favour a rump version of one of the current forms of English degree , with their recurring arguments about canons and coverage , the definition of literature , and the place of theory . Instead , I propose taking the logic of generic concentration as far as it can go , with a @degree@ which would study , in detail , a single genre , poetry . There are certain academic precedents , particularly the uncontroversial establishment in a number of universities of degrees in drama , which do work previously thought of as belonging to an English degree . The other model I have in mind is the degree in music , which is intensive , technical , and demanding , and attracts a small number of well - qualified entrants .
