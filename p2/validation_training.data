This contains the experience and depth of the insider 's knowledge , which Holdaway ( 1979 ) recognizes is unlikely to become readily available , simply because there is a lack of impetus within contemporary sociology to spend lengthy periods of observation in what may be uncomfortable research situations with the police . And here the problem really @begins@ , for the ethnographer must explore beyond the public presentation of self , to seek the underlying discourses of police reality . Inevitably this takes the researcher beyond the press release , the statistical return , or the folk explanation and into an interpretive framework , perhaps to seek how these presentations are used ( often unconsciously ) as part of a well - constructed formula to replicate positions of power and support the ideology and practices of the institution . Immediately the police officer/anthropologist sets out to undertake research or record fieldnotes he is forced to confront a moral dilemma .

According to the Liberal - Irish alliance , the Irish party was supposed to abstain from the 1901 Conservative bill , aimed at bringing denominational schools in England and Wales into the national education system while at the same time absenting them from local government control : that is , giving finance while maintaining the system of denominational clerical control .

Above all acting is not an intellectual occupation , though a good mind is needed to respond imaginatively and practically to the work of authors and directors . An actor can wear his cap as an academic in private conversation as well as the next person , but once on stage the actor responds to the requirements of a scene being @played@ , and works through from moment to moment .

At the end of the twentieth century , at least some colour illustrations are likely to find places in a monograph .

It 's often thought that previous attempts have failed because there are n't enough well - trained classical actors in the USA to make such a repertory company feasible , but this is increasingly not the case : American drama students are eager to train in the UK , and the percentage of successful auditions held is relatively high . In Great Britain the ear becomes accustomed to the native British voice handling the classical text , but this really should not hinder American actors ; they need not become totally accentless in order to @play@ classical verse . Instead they need to find out the rhythms of speech which make the music of the verse work in dramatic form .

It possessed a sense of communitas that was essentially perceived as being dangerous to structure : there is no doubt that from the perspective of incumbents in positions of command or maintenance in structure , communitas even when it becomes normative represents a real danger , and indeed for all those , including even political leaders who spend much of their lives in structural role @playing@ , it represents a temptation . Of course not all policemen are in absolute positions of command even though they represent the maintenance of structure in more than a symbolic way ; and few can move into communitas to experience the temptations described above .

So perhaps my overkill misses the target : perhaps the behaviourist analysis of perception is sound , even though a general behaviourism is not , and what BS lacks is not knowledge of the nature of certain mental states , but only the ability to respond spontaneously to visual stimuli , that is , to respond as a result of actually seeing them . Reflection on the nature of the @argument@ against behaviourism in general , however , reveals that the @argument@ refutes the behaviourist treatment of perception in particular . That argument showed that knowledge of the external world cannot be reduced to behavioural dispositions , for the very idea of a disposition functions only in the context of an unreduced grasp on the physical world . But there is nowhere else that we might get our conception of the physical world from , other than perception .

( Tye does compare this learning to learning to balance a pencil on your nose , but if that comparison is made to do any work , Tye 's theory will simply be a behaviouristic one , and he usually seems to want it to be more than this . ) Tye , however , does have an @argument@ for his conclusion that what is extra is not really something extra . I think the argument is that if we call the nature of the experience R , and if we concede the materialist claim that R is a brain state , then in knowing the brain state the blind scientist knows R , though not what R is like . Because BS knows all the facts about the brain state , and the experience just is the brain state , then what the experience is like must be something other than a fact about the experience .

But a residual effect of the privatizing of sexuality , and in particular of the construction of sexual deviance as an identity , a pathology of being , rather than a kind of behaviour in principle open to all , is that the challenge to this construction often itself remains imprisoned by the public/private dichotomy . So while the whole point of the @argument@ , and rightly , is that when gender is understood as culture rather than nature we see that gender is implicated in all aspects of culture , in practice the argument rarely gets oft the bed . As we shall see shortly , the way out of the bedroom is via the wider cultures , rather than the specific sexual acts , of transgressive reinscription for example , the writings of Wilde , Genet , and others , the subculture from which they emerge and help to form and transform . First there is another objection to be considered : do deviant identities and sexualities really denaturalize through theatrical parody as straightforwardly as is sometimes suggested ?

In this writer 's view , the @arguments@ against multi - denominational education and in favour of catholic schools support an overall political theology which is strongly based on authority within the church .

Just as importantly , he is possessed of a generosity of mind which allows him to be calmly judicious about the merits of writers who can advocate militant homosexuality and drug - taking ( such as Thom Gunn ) , sympathise with feminism ( Elaine Feinstein ) or adhere to some variant of Marxism ( Hugh MacDiarmid ) . Both in his sternness and in his generosity , Davie is strongly reminiscent of a much earlier writer , whose name is invoked towards the end of Under Briggflatts .

argument.n 0 0 0 0 1 0 @ A third effect which could be added is that business experience would be gained by the local merchant , and thus the society begins to develop a pool of people with such business experience . Experience of this nature may reduce the reliance of less developed countries on goods imported from abroad ; local manufacturers may be able to satisfy local market needs by intelligent marketing , and thus gain a larger share of the local market than before , with consequent results for local levels of production and the economy generally . A further element in this @argument@ is the possibility that advertising can be used as part of a marketing strategy to shape the wants and needs of a less developed society in a direction that is clearly beneficial . For instance , if a country concerned still employs traditional systems which , in the light of more modern techniques , appear to be detrimental to public health , it may be desirable to change patterns of behaviour in , say , nutrition or hygiene . Often this will not be successful if the population is attached to its traditional methods and the new methods are radically different from the old ; a careful marketing campaign to change attitudes can have a dramatic effect , particularly by presenting new products in a way that is not dramatically different from the old .

The @argument@ is therefore not about police control or a utopia without controls , but to explore why some cultural behaviour has a history of police action and to discover where that behaviour fits into police ideology . Its status or ( as importantly ) its lack of value creates complex systems of meaning which are rarely articulated ; for the police world has similar strictures to that which Benedict ( 1967 ) described in her attempts to understand the rigidities of Japanese culture : men who have accepted a system of values by which to live , cannot without courting in - efficiency and chaos keep for long a fenced - off portion of their lives where they think and behave according to a contrary set of values .

In addition , the clergy appear to have considerable difficulty in recognizing the transformation which theoretical positions on Christian belief and morality undergo as they are concretized in historical human relationships , doubtless also because of the strong essentialist bias in their perception of socio - ethical issues . Part of the overall @argument@ of this book is that , as the Roman catholic church is principal validator or legitimator of the Southern state along with the concept of the national entity , what that state goes on to do in the field of social ethics cannot be separated out from the responsibilities of the church . This structural link between politics and religion is underlined by the legitimacy the church gives to the state as a whole , by recognizing it simply as society . However , it is the further legitimation given to a particular socio - ethical form of political religion in the constitution and to the implied authority of religious intellectuals in deciding in concreto what must be taken by the state as in the interests of the common good which gives to conflict in Ireland between the two alliances its political religious dimension in the sphere of law.

argument.n 0 0 0 0 1 0 @ FERRARI yesterday decided to drop its appeals against the 32,000 fine and ban imposed on Nigel Mansell following his failure to stop after being disqualified from the Portuguese Grand Prix , writes Maurice Hamilton . The Portuguese authorities had promised to hear Ferrari 's appeal against the fine next Wednesday , after which the FIA , the international automobile federation , was due to reach a decision on Ferrari 's appeal over Mansell 's ban from the Spanish Grand Prix which was staged on 1 October . Ferrari , while still convinced their @arguments@ against the sanctions were valid , but mindful of the tradition they represent , said they wished to remove any disturbing elements from Formula One racing during the final two races of the season in Japan and Australia . Apart from clearing Mansell 's name if they upheld the appeal , the FIA tribunal would be of little further use to either the Englishman or his team . The FIA said last week that the results of the Spanish Grand Prix would remain , regardless of the outcome of any appeal .

Like Douglas , I see no point in setting up a false theoretical dichotomy between us , and them , creating separate realms and polarities of modern and archaic thought , for I anticipate my inclusion of the concept of self can help link the tribalism which haunts the police defensiveness to an understanding of their modern beliefs , modes of thought , and action . Hopefully this will allow the ethnography to extend on the interpretive analysis which Kuper ( 1973 ) termed neostructural and which has since combined aspects of a feminist , semantic , and symbolic framework to generate what may well be a short - lived disciplinary ism of post - modern anthropology ( Young 1989 ) .

argument.n 0 0 0 0 1 0 @ Mr Noel Stock , who speaks as one who had Pound 's confidence in recent years and was in daily contact with him , explains that this passage derives from a hint thrown out by Jessie L. Weston in her from Ritual to Romance , to the effect that the charges of heresy brought against the Templars were not wholly unfounded , since some of the practices of the Eleusinian mystery - cults from the pagan Near East survived in the heart of Christendom in the rituals of the Templars , a survival to be traced in literature in the stories and poems about the quest of the holy grail . From Ritual to Romance came out in 1920 , and was a new book when T.S. Eliot borrowed from it for The Waste Land , thus making it permanently famous ; Pound could not have known of it in 1911 , but if he had then visited the Templars ' cavern - church in Aubeterre he could hardly have failed to remember it in the light of jessie Weston 's @argument@ . Certainly in recent years Pound 's interest in mystery - cults has been more than antiquarian ; in was Erigena ours ? he asks whether the philosopher Scotus Erigena was one of the Eleusinian brotherhood , and ours can be given full weight Noel Stock goes so far as to claim ( op . cit . p.22 ) that some of the obscurity of these later Cantos is deliberate and arcane he writes about them as an initiate in words that are both published and not published .

In the Critique of Pure Reason , Kant 's aim was to show how objective experience is possible , to set out the conditions necessary for this ; whilst Piaget 's aim was to show , given certain Kantian assumptions , how objective experience actually develops .

Much of our daily work was ten years in advance of the official police community involvement programmes and yet our actions were only an extension of those social welfare activities the police have been heavily involved in for generations , but which are never given status as real police work simply because of the institutional emphasis placed upon summons lists , numbers of arrests , crime detections , and other statistical returns .

Reflection on the nature of the argument against behaviourism in general , however , reveals that the argument refutes the behaviourist treatment of perception in particular . That @argument@ showed that knowledge of the external world cannot be reduced to behavioural dispositions , for the very idea of a disposition functions only in the context of an unreduced grasp on the physical world .

The attempt to enforce an evaluative criticism in the academy inevitably results in rigidity and dogmatism and , ultimately , a form of brainwashing . Leavisites , of course , claimed that they were committed to discussion , argument , the free play of mind ; in so far as they were , it was contained within the enclosing form of life , not directed against it , rather like @arguments@ within Marxist - Leninist ideology . It was this aspect of Leavisism that Oxford English , with its broad though often flaccid eclecticism , was most opposed to . Venturing to propound a law of intellectual life , I suggest that evaluative criticism enters institutional literary study under the influence of practising writers , or of critics who have a close discipular relation to them , but that in time it is rejected , like an alien organ .

The second and more important point is that the general @argument@ against behaviouristic theories does take in functionalism and is not merely directed against traditional behaviourism : it works against any theory that analyses one 's conception of the world simply in terms of the way one functions that is , behaves in the world . The addition of internal discriminations within the nervous system adds nothing relevant to this , unless the internal discriminations really possessed semantic properties , so that they somehow contained in themselves a real description of the world . But it is accepted by physicalists of all kinds that the meaning or semantic value of internal states must be analysed in terms of their causal relations to stimulus and response , just as it is for the behaviourist 's dispositions , and is not something they possess in their own right , or of themselves .

The justification of Mr Pound 's thesis in How To Read is not his @arguments@ , but his poetry . Leavis , who countered How To Read with a booklet , How to Teach Reading , and Winters , who declared in 1937 , Mr Pound resembles a village loafer who sees much and understands little , told the same story as Tate : Pound was a naf , an imagination and sensory apparatus that consistently performed better than it knew , in ways that the maker 's own discursive intelligence failed to comprehend or measure up to ; in Winters 's memorable and mordant judgement of 1943 , a sensibility without a mind , or with as little mind as is well possible .

His @argument@ is as follows : a man 's masculinity is indeed insecure ; it is an endless trial , a precariously held , endlessly tested , unstable condition ( p. 91 ) . In this it is almost tragic : the unique vulnerability to tailed expectations is the fatal flaw in the masculine ego the testing of masculinity knows no bounds to prove oneself remains a lifelong necessity .

The response to this is that intentionality and consciousness are emergent properties of physical systems .

This may look like an easy knock - down @argument@ against a silly theory which nobody has ever seriously held : but what is true of mental pictures would seem to be true of any kind of mental representing process which encodes sensations in some determinate form . In other words , the argument works equally against the view that we think in a kind of mental language , that mental sentences rather than mental pictures are the stuff of thought . Sentences and words also require interpretation indeed they would seem to require this more obviously than pictures and so we 're back on the circle of infinite regress .

The announcement , hastily brought forward from the middle of the month , was designed to forestall other lenders from following the Yorkshire Building Society , which lifted its rate to 15 per cent at the weekend .

The answer must be not a great deal ; for none of the portents of success are immediately apparent . WPC Dick 's salutary essay ( 1985 ) changed little and generated few ripples on the ACPO pond , while one of the most powerfully critical books on policing in recent years ( Jones 1980 ) seems to have had little effect on the structures of the organization , except , perhaps , to help draw its author then a chief inspector into the ACPO ranks .

Hopefully , he can use the creativity which exists between the experiential inside view and observational outside view of a cultural system to formulate an ethnography which incorporates a continuous dialectical , tacking between the most local of detail and the most global of global structures in such a way as to bring them into simultaneous view ( Geertz ibid . 235 ) .

This structural awareness can be as hard to handle as any decision to try to publish the account , for what has happened in the past and what is expected now from the insider is tied up with an understanding of how the institution of policing prefers to present a restricted image for outside consumption , as I have described above .

The main grounds appeared to be the danger which it might pose to the small Southern protestant minority by encouraging mixed marriages . However , no evidence favouring such a contention has ever been @produced@ . Harry MacAdoo , then the Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin , on several occasions put forward the argument that Southern protestants were a minority group with their own culture and traditions , and thus deserved to have schools for themselves in order to hand on their own traditions .

produce.v 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 @ Greenhill ( 1981 ) , then a lecturer at the college , discussed this history of police/sociology antagonism in detail , arguing a tendency in each side to discredit the other ; resulting in a situation where the number of published British texts and research studies on the sociology of the police may be numbered on the fingers of both hands . I suspect Greenhill was referring specifically to a dearth in the cultural analysis of policing , while his use of the duality of sides reveals another parallel binary to that of cops and robbers , with the police and sociology arraigned against each other in yet another of the wars which the police wage against those who defile the sanctity of their definition of the concept of order . Constant separations between the two categories are promoted , @producing@ a dichotomized vision of left - wing , radical reformists , antagonistic to the right - minded boys in blue and includes a wealth of negative imagery of sociology which is lodged deep in the collective consciousness of the police mind . The sociologist , as I shall illustrate , is the despised , hairy , intellectual subversive , who is set against the clean and ordered British bobby . To reinforce a belief in their own omnipotence and popularity , the police have made increasing use of market research to show they are well liked ; especially by that important category the silent majority .
