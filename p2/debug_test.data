begin.v 0 1 0 0 0 @ Here Leonard discovered the Greek way of life its alternating rhythms of work and leisure , both on the seasonal and the daily basis , which are so conducive to creative thought and achievement . Here he was able to stand back from the onrush of western man and ask himself the real questions of life and meaning ; get his young life , full and successful as it had been , into perspective . Here he @began@ to crystallise the wisdom of some of his best poetry , writing and songs ; for it was here that he was reborn , where he truly began to find himself ; where , not least , the music of Greece entered his soul , evoking earlier memories and melodies , combining with them to suggest a new style , a new mystique . ( Filled with wonder at the sound of the bazouki , as Jacques Vassal commented ; also emphasising Leonard 's appreciation of Theodorakis 's then emerging art . ) Perhaps the words of his Old Dialogue ( Flowers for Hitler , p128 ) come from this time , overshadowed as they are with other meanings and claims :
begin.v 0 1 0 0 0 @ Dear Harsnet , he wrote , this is a message from the past . I just want to tell you . Goldberg , pushing aside pad and pen , drew the little typewriter towards him and @began@ to type again . The procreative metaphor , he typed ( as Harsnet had written ) , has been the bane of art . It is not enough , wrote Harsnet , to deny that one conceives a work of art and brings it forth as a child is conceived and brought forth into the world .

Outside , shapes @began@ to materialize heads , implements they wanted to recognize friends but they could see nothing but shawls , cloaks , silhouettes . The muzzle of a gun poked up would they be caught in crossfire ? The tines of a fork rattled to the glass of the little window , a face stared in just inches away , they recognized Donald McCulloch before he whisked backwards out of sight .

There is no end to it all , wrote Harsnet ( typed Goldberg ) . When you @begin@ to think about it you grow dizzy , your stomach turns over , not just at the commercialism of it all , but at the aestheticism of it all , not just at the chequebooks but at the Intelligent Conversations , not just at the fifty percent but at the Sensitive Responses , not just at the winks and nods but at the Hushed Silence in the Presence of Art . Our civilization will be destroyed , he wrote , not by the Bomb but by its reverence for the Creative Spirit . Better never enter a church , he wrote , than enter in a spirit of false awe .
begin.v 0 1 1 0 0 @ However , he wrote , for that very reason , the right hand side should have been even more solid , even more thought through than the left . But there it is , he wrote . The plans are made , work has @begun@ , there is no going back . Work as the fancy takes me , he wrote . A little bit here , a little bit there .

I ran down the pavement to get as far away from the hotel as I could , then I sat down in a doorway and continued crying . Slowly the tears subsided and gradually I @began@ to pull myself together . I had nearly got myself killed back there : what on earth did I think I was playing at ? The people back at the hotel did n't know me .

When he came to the words , Then said his wife unto him , Dost thou still retain thy integrity ? , Cameron @began@ to wonder if Mr Menzies was identifying himself with Job , and when he ended ringingly on Shall we receive good at the hand of God , and shall we not receive evil ? , the suspicion was confirmed . Clear yellow sunlight shone through the window - panes , making a pattern of diamonds on the plasterwork . Children in the congregation watched the diamonds slowly grow squarer , less elongated , as the sun moved down the sky .
begin.v 0 0 1 0 0 @ Amnesty groups ' work responded to the challenge with new techniques such as networks focusing on abuses in specific areas of the world and campaigns on whole countries or themes . For example , a Murder by Governments Campaign in October 1983 resulted in funeral marches with black coffins , drumbeats , and candles in Diss , Norwich , Bognor Regis , and London . How to find the money necessary to carry out Amnesty 's work has always been a worry , and from the very @beginning@ the Section Office asked groups for help in this area . However , in the first few years groups did not appear to consider fundraising a priority . A newsletter in 1964 complains that it is clear that the requested 10 per annum is more than one group can manage .
begin.v 0 1 0 0 0 @ So , wrote Harsnet , there is continuity as well as discontinuity , but that does not mean , he wrote , that there exists what is called character , personality , character , Goldberg wrote in the margin , personality , as they seem to think , wrote Harsnet ( and Goldberg went on typing ) , when they say you have such a generous character if you would only recognize it , or you have so much to offer , or it is not for myself I speak but for you , not for myself I mourn but for the waste of all that generosity , when they pour those words over you , character , generosity , warmth , looking sad , shedding tears , putting on a brave face , saying do n't pay any attention to me , or , it 's nothing , forget it , I 'm crying for the waste , meaning waste if it 's not directed towards them , but you have only to see what happens when one lets oneself be persuaded by that sort of thing , wrote Harsnet , you have only to see what happened to Hutchinson , MacMahon , Rollins and Goldberg . Taken in by the image of yourself they present you with , wrote Harsnet , instead of waiting in patience for the beginning , instead of waiting and then beginning , though beginning , having begun , he wrote , is not everything , is far from everything . It is quite possible , he wrote , that it will lead nowhere , even when one has @begun@ at the right time in the right spirit , or at least not at the wrong time , in the wrong spirit , with the wrong plans and having made the wrong preparations , with the wrong tools and the wrong principles , on the wrong surface and with the wrong conception . Though it may well be , he wrote , that one actually achieves more working with the wrong plans and in the wrong spirit , with the wrong tools and the wrong principles , on the wrong surface and with the wrong conception , it may well be , he wrote ( and Goldberg typed ) , that one achieves more than working with the right plans and in the right spirit , with the right tools and the right principles , on the right surface and with the right conception , though right and wrong and more and less are relative concepts and what seems right at one moment to one person may seem wrong at the same moment to another Person or at another moment to the same person , and what seems more to one person at one moment may seem less to another person at the same moment or at another moment to the same person , right , wrong , more , less , relative concepts , scribbled Goldberg , in the margin , panting slightly as he bent over his old Olivetti Portable , there is only the beginning , wrote Harsnet , or rather , there is only having begun , beginning , scribbled Goldberg , aware now of the black stains on his hands left by the felt - tip pen , having begun , there is only the feeling in the pit of the stomach or the feeling in the chest , wrote Harsnet , the feeling of sickness or the feeling of elation , those are not relative , he wrote , those are absolute . Yet is it possible to assert , he wrote , that work done with a lifting of the heart is better than work done with a contracting of the stomach ?
