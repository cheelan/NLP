From the @beginning@ it was too late , he wrote . It was too late to begin and too late not to begin . Too late for me and too late for the world .

begin.v 0 0 1 0 0 @ Nightmares and night - time anxiety , are a regular feature of Leonard 's work , though he did remark to us , I do n't think that I was scarred by anything . For someone whose life has been lived in search of the word , who perceived that a scar is what happens when the word is made flesh , who owned that his education began on hearing of the Holocaust , it is not a convincing comment . It may well be that his nocturnal anxieties @began@ on hearing the nightly ministrations by which his father was nursed to a young boy , eerie and mysterious , doubtless at times frenetic ; no doubt they were exacerbated after his death , as sorrow and loss impinged . Night itself occurs several times in his early books of poetry , as it was bound to do , and its references are of an intimidating sort : the night never ending ( in Letter ) , and the clinic of your thighs against the night ( in Let Us Compare Mythologies ; the latter intimating that other experience of the night which such high thinkers as Bertrand Russell found laden with sexual feelings ) . In The Spice - Box Of Earth he has a particularly pointed reference to it : Night , my old night

For other prey , a rat for instance , death would be next . But the dog , toad between teeth , jaws primed to gnash , @began@ to foam , in spurts , like a washing machine , and dropped the beast on its uneven back leaving me to confront the hideous creature putting itself to rights . The dog is long since gone , though not , so far as I know , as a result of its encounter with the toad . My ex is now my ex .
begin.v 0 1 0 1 0 @ Testing the Alliance 2 : The Mother and Child Scheme Controversy The second case reveals even more the extent to which the legitimation of the state was a Roman catholic affair , at least as one of the two principal sources of power in the alliance . From the early 1940s , the Irish government @began@ to work towards the introduction of a comprehensive health service for mothers and children in line with other legislative developments in Western countries . There can be no doubt that the lack of such a programme bore heavily upon the poor , and that poor health and mortalities were a consequence . In 1946 there were already signs of clerical opposition to any socialization of welfare in queries about Fianna Fil 's proposals from Archbishop McQuaid and the Confederation of Convent Schools .

Reading around for background to Shakespeare is valuable , and you ca n't do better than @begin@ with the Harley Granville Barker 's Prefaces to Shakespeare , which analyse the plays from both a scholarly and dramatic angle , without being ponderously academic . John Barton 's Playing Shakespeare is a fine follow - up. Barton does investigate the actor 's work in a more contemporary way and the book is based on the TV series of the same name .

And yet , he wrote , if the glass is to be any sort of advance , it will be because of the middle . Because it is nothing but a middle , without @beginning@ or end . The beauty of glass , he wrote , is this , that the surface does not have to be covered . Much of the middle , in fact , he wrote , will depend on where it is set up .
begin.v 0 1 0 0 0 @ The Gorbals comes across , in careful descriptions , as a ferocious place . It should be seen for what it was , and especially by those who feel like regretting its erasure , and alleging that its replacement has made an environment which may be even worse of tower blocks filled with heroin and despair . The trouble is that the allegation has @begun@ to seem convincing . The hovels and the vennels of the nineteenth - century Scottish city have been projected into the sky ; the lower depths of the Thirties have not gone from urban Britain . And we have a government which has been slow to worry whether the people there die of Aids .

Not , he wrote ( and Goldberg went on typing ) , that here in London one is cut off from such supplies in the normal course of events , but that work cannot @begin@ until one knows one will not have to bother with such things , for a while at least . It is not a question , he wrote , of drawing up an inventory of all that is required , because that suggests that one can know exactly what will be required . Everything possible must be done , he wrote , and yet it must be as though nothing had been done .
