1,1,Just got back from 2 days up in Chicago shopping with girlfriends. First time I have stayed at the Omni. I did so because I saw a $129.00 rate that included $25.00 of free food on Travelzoo. The three of us (55 year olds) all stayed in one suite with 2 double beds and a VERY comfortable pull out sofa. We had plenty of room. Food in the restaurant was great; service was outstanding from everone we came into contact with; early morning delivery of free coffee; juice and hot chocolate was fabulous and recommendations from the staff on where to eat; time of movies; shopping areas; etc was really helpful. Need I mention the outstanding location? Simply the best! We all decided that the Omni is our new favorite hotel.
0,1,I absolutely loved staying at the Swissotel Chicago. The entire hotel has such an elegant and luxurious feel to it. The room was absolutely stunning! First of all; it was so spotless and clean. The design of it was beautiful! There was gorgeous artwork on the walls even. The design was very modern and above average for hotel decor. There was a separate bath and separate shower which I loved! There was a huge LCD flat screen TV and high speed wireless Internet available. There was even an iPod docking station which was great for listening to music and so convenient since I brought my iPod with me! The view from the window of Chicago was beautiful too. The service was very quick and everyone was very friendly. I didn't have any problems at all but if I did I'm sure the customer service at the hotel would have had it fixed very quick I could tell their top priority was the guests happiness and satisfaction! There were even two restaurants in the hotel and a lounge! I can't wait to go back to this hotel. It felt like I was on a luxurious vacation!
1,1,On our visit to Chicago; we chose the Hyatt due to its location in downtown; within walking distance to most major attractions; such as Sears Tower; Magnificent Mile; Grant/Millenium Parks; etc. Subway & bus stops very close by to travel to other locations in the city . Overall the hotel was very nice; clean; and at a great location. Was in a safe area. Went to beautiful Wrigley Field and Soldier Field and saw both teams play. I love Chicago and would defenitely stay here again!
1,0,I would NOT recommend staying at the Swissotel in Chicago. I was travelling with a friend and we arrived at different times. She had booked the hotel but had added my name to the reservation since I would be arriving first. The "night manager" at the hotel was extremely rude and told me I could not check in since they could not find the note about my name being on the reservation. (this was THEIR mistake) They told me I could sit in the lobby for 4 hours until my friend arrived. They did nothing to try and help me until I stood there and complained for twenty minutes. I can't believe that a "manager" would treat a customer this way. There are other great hotels in Chicago. This hotel is not worth the aggravation!
1,0,We arrived and thought for $350 a night; it would be a decent place. Good reviews;etc... We arrived to find that the website pictures were misleading. The hotel lounge was a "room"; it was really odd and very dark. The first night there I noticed that the blanket on the bed was nasty looking. Resembled something you'd find on a street. To top it all off we woke up after night #2 to find that bed bugs had attacked us. My husband and I were both bitten. I was bitten WAY more than my husband. My legs were covered with bites. I was on ointments and Benadryl for over a week. I immediately came home and scalded all our clothes. There was also mold around the tub both inside it and on the floor by it. The bathroom floor was also curling up by the tub. The view in room #607 is of a roof. Not good. The stay was VERY disappointing. The only good thing there is the free breakfast on every floor.
0,0,My husband and I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park. What I expected to be a very pleasant experience; turned out to be a stressful visit. We specifically reserved a non-smoking king room and paid the price for that reservation. Upon arrival; the hotel did not have any non-smoking rooms available and the representative at the check in desk was not helpful. As we had no other options; we accepted a smoking room with two queen beds. I can live with the bed situation but I truly feel that having to accept a room infused with cigarette smoke is completely wrong! There wasn't an area in the room where I did not feel nauseous from the stale smell and I cannot help but think that this smell followed me around all day after check out. To add insult to injury; the hotel staff was not sympathetic to our situation -- something I think they should be specifically trained to do -- and did not offer any compensation; partial refund or related "perk" to make up for our great inconvenience. Two staff members actually acted as if I was the inconvenience in asking them if there was anything they could do! Although we paid for the breakfast package; we were eager to leave immediately in the morning and dined elsewhere at our additional expense. Pardon the pun; but we just could not sit there and dine in the morning with such a bad taste in our mouth from the hotel's lack of customer service! I am hoping the corporate office responds to our complaints but; thus far; we have received no satisfaction. Needless to say; we will not be visiting this property again! In fact; we are no longer going to patronize this brand of hotels.
0,0,For a hotel rated with four diamonds by AAA; one would think the Hilton Chicago would be almost like staying at a palace with royalty. The only royal thing about this hotel however is that it was a royal nightmare. I should have known from the moment I walked in with my wife that this was going to become a bigger headache than what it was worth. First off; as soon as we arrived to check in at the hotel with the clerk who couldn't be any older than nineteen or twenty; red flags started going up. The clerk was extremely rude and lazy; acting like it was a chore even getting up from texting on his cell phone. If that wasn't bad enough; the clerk pretty much ignored me while blatantly staring at my wife's breasts. She wasn't even wearing anything that could be considered skimpy as it was cold out and she was wearing a turtle neck sweater under a large fur lined coat. After diverting his atention several times we finally got our room keys. It shouldn't have been any surprise when we learned that there were no one to help us with our luggage as the clerk said they were all out on break. Okay; that was annoying; but we managed easy enough. We finally got to the third floor where our suite had been reserved for over a month and we looked forward to resting after our long trip. To our surprise; not to mention our disgust and horror; their was already a couple in what was supposed to be our room on the bed making out. It took almost a half hour between the couple in the room; the front desk; and my wife and me to get it straightened out. Apparently the night clerk didn't bother following policy as they had taken our reservation off the computer to give to their friends while leaving the printed card for the day clerk. After what could only be described as chaos; we were finally given another room on the next floor up. We were thankful when we got to it and my wife went to use the bathroom while I dropped our luggage by the beds. Hearing a clinking sound I bent down to look what one of the bags could have hit to see an empty beer bottle sticking out from under the bed. I was about to call back down to give the clerk a piece of my mind when I heard my wife cry out. There on the wall of the bathroom were several roaches crawling around and I noticed something else in the sink that almost made us leave then and there. There; in the sink and in very plain sight; was a used condom! So far we were less than thrilled about being there and we stomred back downstairs and demanded our money back. By then the desk manager had returned from where ever she went off to and talked us into taking another room; free of charge to make up for our troubles. The room itself was thankfully clean with no bugs and no trash or any other disgusting items laying around. Despite being a lot smaller and not having the promised view that our other room should have had; we decided to make due. So while my wife went to get cleaned up after our long trip I pulled my laptop out to use the so called high speed internet access. I shouldn't have even bothered as I've used dial up that went at least three times as fast as the speeds I was getting. With a quick call to the desk I was informed the person responsible for the internet was gone for the day and there was nothing that could be done for the moment. So instead of worrying about it; we went to get something to eat from the the onsite dinning area. Yet again we were met with rude people who either stared at my wife's chest or forgot half of our order. After arguing with them for what seemed like forever over not getting everything; we found that our found was not only bland; it was cold! We didn't even bother trying anything else; that was the final straw so we got our things and found another hotel. I don't know who would hire a bunch or rude employees who was barely out of high school or who couldn't clean a room; but I know that that hotel didn't deserve four diamonds unless it was in the negative. That place should be shut down because there is no way they know how to run a decent hotel.
0,0,Hilton Chicago - Not worth the price. Our room on the second floor was very noisy due to traffic. The windows faced the street; and we couldn't even see the harbor. The loop was much farther than expected. It wound up being an hour walk round trip.
1,0,Fairmont Hotels are generally my preferred choice; but this was a true disappointment. Check-in was quite slow and problematic (glitches with their reservation system locally). Room was very small and oddly arranged. Felt quite cramped in room and was hard to work at very small desk. Hotel overall felt quite cold and isolating...lobby is not at all inviting; and it didn't feel terribly safe walking around outside. Gift shop was overpriced; even for a downtown hotel. Food was disappointing. Overall this seems greatly overpriced and does not meet usual standards of A Fairmont i've come to count on. Bill was completely messed up and required 3 separate calls after i left to straighten out.

The front desk staff had an attitude and was impatient about us asking questions about various details of the hotel and the neighborhood. Very upsetting especially after a long flight.}
0,1,There were many positives when staying in this hotel at the north end of the Magnificant Mile. The rooms were spacious and beautifully appointed with great attention to detail. The quality of service was excellent; the staff professional; and the location was perfect. There are great views of Chicago from many of the rooms. The staff seemed to care about the quality of my stay from the moment I was greeted upon arrival to the moment I got in my taxi to leave. There is a nice rooftop bar/restaurant perfect for a lite meal or a refreshing cocktail with great views of the city. There really weren't any negatives and I would recommend this boutique hotel to anyone staying in the Chicago area.
1,1,Stayed here for one night in June; but have stayed here before when on business in Chicago. Great location for business/shopping/sightseeing. In between Michigan Avenue's Magnificent Mile and the Loop and next to the Chicago River. Rooms very spacious and clean. Gym has a wonderful view; as it is situated on the top of the hotel. Bar next to lobby; very busy with good atmosphere. Cannot fault the hotel. Prefer it to the Westin - my previous address when in Chicago.
1,0,We stayed two nights. We were registered by a very unfriendly desk attendant. He was very cold. Our room was very; very small and the closet did not even hold the few clothes we packed for two days. The room was stylishly decorated but lacked the nice small touches such as an extra pillow in the closet. We were attracted to this hotel because a bar was on the ground level - however when we went to have a drink; the door to the bar was locked. We called to inquire why the sign said was open when it really wasn't and were told they were short staffed; 'sorry'. WHAT?? are you running here? You are a hotel in the country's third largest city and your amenities are open at whim? This was our first and last visit to a Kimpton hotel.
1,0,This hotel does not belong in the same league as The Peninsula; Four Seasons; or Ritz Carlton. It was more like staying at an overpriced W Hotel. Staff was very nice and attentive; but the lobby is cramped; and only two small elevators for 17 floors!! Several times the elevator was full by the time it reached our floor; and we were forced to take the stairs. The hotel must be flooding the travel websites itself with high reviews.
0,0,when i first checked the hotel's website and reviews i was completely sure that it would be a great hotel and i would have a great time there. but i was totally disappointed once i got there; first of all i asked for a nonsmoking room because i hate the odor ; and in fact they gave me a non smoking room which smelled worse than a smoking one; it was smelly in a bad way it smelled like sweat and dirty laundry or something like that. then when i was trying to enjoy the view; they windows were all dusty and dirty. so i decided to get out of the room ; and i went to the pool and it wasnt what i expected either it has nothing to do with the picture . so i went back to my room and called room service for them to complain about the smell and dirt so they gave me another room which smelled even worse!. i was about to freak out so they gave me some deodorant and it was tolerable; the bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom eww!; its all i can say about this hotel.
1,0,Before booking this hotel; I did read the reviews; and I was concerned. I ended up booking it based on my sisters recommendation. BIG MISTAKE!! The temperature in Chicago was a balmy 99 degrees; and the temp in the room that they gave us was about 85 degrees. When we called to complain at 11:00 am; they told us to turn the temp down to 40degrees. We went back at 7:30pm. it was still humid; the beds were moist & the room very stuffy. Called again; they sent somone to fix it; & he recommended getting a new room; because the room will not cool down. They told us they were booked; yet; after the maintenance man called; they suddenly had a room available; go figure? So they move us to another room; guess what; it is 85 degrees. Again; they told us to turn it down to 40; needless to say; it never cooled down & we should have just slept on the street. We travel a lot; and we stayed here one night; and it was awful!!. At check out; I had to re-tell our entire room issue; they actually ended up not charging us for the night; thank god they did not offer us anothers nights stay; because we would never go back. Also; the room decor is very old and stuffy. If your going to Chicago; don't stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker!!
0,1,The hotel was very nice; Service was great; everyone was very friendly. The room was very elegant and classy. The bed was so comfortable. The room also had a flat screen TV and Bose sound system. Not bad. Overall I had a great experience; with a pleasant staff and perfectly comfortable room; I left here well rested and happy.
0,0,This place was absolutely foul. From the minute I walked in; I knew making a reservation here was a mistake. The person at the counter would barely make eye contact with me and acted like I was asking a huge favor of them in order to check in. The room we requested (a room with double beds) was not available. They told me that when I made the reservation; requesting double beds was a "request" and not a "guarantee." What's the point of making a reservation; then? When we got to the room; the room was totally gross. The decor was dated; the carpet was torn in spots and the whole place smelled musty and almost moldy. The bathroom had spots and stains all over it. I hesitate to think of the true cleanliness of the sheets. The "complimentary" fitness area was a joke. One broken treadmill and a couple of mismatched dumbbells. Thanks but no thanks. We will definitely not return.
1,0,The room wasvery tiny and was very warm. They give you the illusion that you control the temperature but they do. The bathroom is small. The tub is plastic retro fit as stated in another review; and does crackle under your feet. I; personally; did find the water pressure to be fine and the bath ammenities to be of good quality. The public areas are nice and are good to hang out in. This is basically an old hotel that has been updated. The comment about the closet is true; it is actually indescriable. You can hear everything occuring in the other rooms. The location is convienent but so are many other hotels. If you do stay; fly into Midway; take the Orange Line; you cannot go wrong.
0,0,I really expected great things when I made reservations at the Fairmont Chicago. Given its reputation (and price point) one would think the staff would work hard to deliver a premium experience; but I was disappointed several times. The desk staff mixed up our reservation and we ended with a lesser room than we asked for; with a window opening into an utterly ugly alley. To add insult to injury; our room service breakfast was bland and cold; delivered by the most unenthusiastic service staff I have ever encountered. Plus; the bathroom was awkwardly shaped; for instance the toilet paper was a very long reach. Needless to say; I will not be returning.
0,1,Going to the swissotel Chicago was fantastic!! My husband and I got the Bed and Breakfast package which was completely affordable for a great get away from the children! The room was so spacious and the beds were so cozy! At night we went to dinner at the hotel restaurant; the Palm and had an amazing lobster dinner â€“ the lobsters were huge and worth every cent! The next morning after a great breakfast; we asked the concierge for some suggestions and he suggested us go to the Shedd Aquarium. It was a great decision â€“ we saw so many beautiful fish! Overall the swissotel Chicago was a great stay! My husband and I are planning another trip with the children soon!
0,1,This hotel allowed me to experience the best of Chicago. The central downtown location was perfect for me and my boyfriend to come and go as we pleased; whether during the day or at night. It was a great get-away spot for me to relax away from work. Probably one of the best beds I've ever slept on. The Italian food that they served at Harry Carey's reminded me of when I lived in Italy. Overall a completely amazing experience. I can't wait to book my next stay here.
0,1,An excellent vacation destination. Clean rooms and many nice features. Superb location and proximity to local attractions. Staff is always friendly and eager to help. Highly recommended to anyone looking to travel to this area.
1,0,The Palmer House has a beautiful lobby with a great bar and restaurant. The rooms are way too small!!! Two people in a room with a King size bed can barely move around. Not enough room for two suitcases. Our room was very outdated-reminded us of the movie The Shining. VERY NOISY!!!! Don't expect a quiet stay. You can hear EVERYTHING that your neighbors are doing and saying not to mention everything that is happening in the hallways. We requested a room change as soon as we checked in. The room that we originally were in had a huge square cut out of the wall that had exposed pipes; bricks; dirt and dust. Oh and the construction for their renovations starts at 7 a.m. during the week. We will never stay at the Palmer House again. You are better off spending a few more dollars at a different hotel.
1,1,Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Talbott. This was our first visit there; and I can honestly say that I wouldn't stay at any other hotel in Chicago. From when we first were greated by the bell captain until our final departure; the staff was nothing less than amazing; always greeting with a smile and can I help you attitute. The room we had (1508) was very spacious and comfortable. The bed was probably the most comfortable that my wife and I have ever slept in (including the Four Seasons). Had great breakfasts and drinks at Basil's. You would be missing a fantastic experience; if you didn't stay at the Talbott.
1,0,Had a week long stay at the Hilton on south Michigan while attending a meeting. The hotel has some elegance in the lobby; meeting rooms and lounges - the hotel rooms could definitely use updating. I would definitely say that for the price of a room here - the rooms should be top notch. My car was misplaced during valet parking; our reservations were messed up; hotel staff showed up repeatedly throughout the week at our door with items (room service; a new coffee pot; laundry) that wasn't ours. I would not stay at this property again. There are much better places for the money in close proximity to Michigan Ave. It is a very big hotel and at times it felt like we were staying at Faulty Towers.
1,1,this is my new favorite place to stay in downtown chicago; and I've been to this hotel at least 4 times. the rooms are clean; wonderfully designed and comfortable. The staff is friendly; service focused - and the restuarant is great; especially for the breakfast fruit crepes. Love this hotel. It's a great location; very good and consistent service and quality .
0,1,My wife and I stayed at the allegro this weekend while I was on a business trip. I was very impressed with their hospitality and my wife very much(maybe too much) enjoyed the in-house spa. Rooms service was a bit slow but; overall great hotel would stay again.
0,0,http://www.swissotelchicago.com/ - I stayed in the Swissotel in-between flights; and overall the experience was unpleasant. Despite being very tired from my travels; the city-noise completely penetrated the obviously thin walls and kept me up all night. The next morning; I had to find to find a cab to get me to Midway Airport (it was way too far away to walk with luggage); and while in the middle of explaining directions to me; the concierge left me to talk to another customer.
0,0,Conrad Chicago âˆ’ Having read the reviews; I had very high expectations for this hotel; but it was mediocre at best. The location is very good indeed (one block from Mag Mile); but that's it. I booked a room with "a view" and as it turned out; the "view" was of the building next to the hotel; no joke! Besides that; the TV wasn't working; so I called the manager and their solution was to "downgrade" me to another room. Frankly it was better to move to a cheaper room; because "the view" was clearly not worth paying for; but still; it was a very poor handling of the situation. Both rooms were large and clean and the bathroom was OK; but there was so much noise from the street that I actually had a hard time trying to sleep. Breakfast was largely overpriced (I spent around $30) and so was parking. Staff was cold most of the time and the manager didn't even apologize for the room change. Frankly for the price they charge I expected much more. Next time I go to Chicago; I will look for other hotels where I can get more from my money.
0,1,I frequently have business meetings in Downtown Chicago and find that the Hotel Monaco Chicago; gives me the peace of mind to make those meetings enjoyable. While it might be more expensive than your average hotel....but there is nothing average in this hotel. Exceeds any expectations - service; food; quality; atmosphere were heads above anywhere. Thanks for making my trips to Chicago - the best of the best.
0,1,Conrad Chicago âˆ’ Very nice stay overall. I was upgraded on check-in and got a large room on 12th floor. Confortable bed; large TV and decent desk for work. Wi-Fi was included. The bathroom had bath and shower separated and the shower had a strong water flow; which I appreciate. I ate breakfast in the hotel three times and it was very tasty; with lots of variety. I am Brazilian and was surprised to see Pao de Queijo being served in an American hotel. :) A bit pricey though. The location is top-notch; one block from Mag Mile on Michigan Ave. If you want to spend a lot of time (and money) shopping; this is the place to be. Tip: if you are traveling on business; check if there is a conference room on your floor before reservation; because not all floors have (mine dindn't). Pros: good VFM; location; great service Cons: noisy I would certainly stay again!
1,1,Beautifully appointed; professionally staffed; comfortable; well-located; and elegant; with wireless internet access (plus free access in an alcove on the second floor); fitness center (a little small but fine if you use it at the right time); good energy clientele; easy access to Michigan Avenue; next door to 24-hour restaurant; 2 blocks from 2 Starbucks; elevators that are there before you get your finger off the button - they thought of everything. Will definitely return!
1,1,Stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for 3 nights in early April 2007. Very convenient location just a block from all of the shopping on the Golden Mile. Good restaurant at the hotel serving a la carte breakfast different from the usual fare and with a nice French twist. Dinner at the restaurant was also good. Prices are reasonable. Room is comfortable; only problem was with a card access door lock that usually required several swipes before opening. Excellent service from the bellmen to the concierge and front desk staff. Would definitely stay here again if visiting Chicago. Concierge recommended a small van tour; which was excellent. However early April is too early to visit Chicago as popular activities such as the boat tour of the architecture of Chicago was not operating yet.
1,1,We stayed in the Conrad for 4 nights just before Thanksgiving. We had a corner room overlooking N Michigan Av and the Tribune Building. To say this is a 5 star hotel is to damn this place with faint praise - it is wonderful. The staff were unbelievably helpful. The standard of the room was superb - HD plasma screens; luxury bedlinens; iPod radio; huge bathroom. Location is unbeatable - right in the heart of everything - watched the whole Light Festival parade from the window. Breakfasts were excellent - no help yourself buffet here - with full and attentive table service. Would have no hesitation recommending or staying again in this hotel - 5 out of 5.
0,1,I have to admit; I was a little leery about visiting Chicago due to my mild agoraphobia; but after a family member reserved a room at the Hotel Allegro Chicago; my fears were slightly assuaged. A few friends of mine had stayed in this hotel before; and had nothing but positive things to say. With this new-found optimism in mind; I went forward on my journey in confidence. I have to say; I was not let down. From the moment I stepped into the lobby; I felt at home. The concierge called bellboys to move our luggage from the taxi to our rooms; and the check-in process was fast and efficient. The rooms themselves are incredibly homey; feeling less like a hotel room and more like the guest room at a millionaire's mansion. The high comfort level coupled with prompt service when requesting items such as extra pillows and towels; really helped alleviate my apprehensions about staying in Chicago; and provided a secure place to stay at night; or whenever I did not feel like participating with the group. Of course; the rooms are second only to the overall feel of the hotel. I found myself spending less of my downtime in my room and more of it wandering around the building. Overall it's very cozy; and has a certain old-world feeling to it; once again lending to it feeling less like a hotel and more like a mansion at times. It was never overwhelmingly crowded; and the people I did encounter were incredibly friendly; yet not intrusive. I don't usually enjoy staying in hotels; but I love the Allegro Chicago!
0,1,I went to Chicago on business last year and I had the pleasure of staying at the luxurious Hyatt Regency Hotel. I opted for the Business Plan; although they have many different room descriptions available to choose from; such as the Allergy Friendly; Monarch Suite; State Suite; all the way up to the Presidential Suite. My suite was a perfect blend of business and comfort; equipped with Wi-Fi; a generous 37 inch television; spacious work area and two queen sized beds you sink into feeling tension ease from your body. I dined at the Stetson's Chop Shop restaurant and the meal was portioned generously and very well prepared. The staff was curtious and accommodating. For breakfast; I opted to have my meal brought to my room where I started my business day over a delicious hot meal and strong; gourmet coffee. I would highly recommend this wonderful haven to anyone planning an overnight Chicago stay.
0,1,My fiance and I had taken a trip to Chicago and wanted to stay someplace close to Downtown; so he chose the Amalfi Hotel; located conveniently to everything we needed. This place was phenomenal!!! He chose a romantic getaway package; as we were only in town for a few days and it was the best choice ever. The hotel is super clean and very chic; the beds are so comfortable and the staff is superb. We were able to bring along our dog; which was also really important to us. The first day we were there; we had gone out during the day with our dog and came back to an in-room couple's massage. The masseuses come straight to your room so it's really relaxing and stress-relieving and they were great. After our massages; we went to the Keefer Steakhouse; which the hotel gave us a gift certificate for and the food was fantastic. They do also have a great continental breakfast and we did also eat at the Rocket grill; which was nice as well. In all; our 3 nights there were pretty similar; we went out during the day and had a great time at the hotel while we were there; I've recommended this place to a few of my clients going to the Windy City.
1,1,Stayed at the Talbott for over a week and enjoyed our stay. Room was a little noisy as we were next to the lift; but everything else made up for that. Positives: Bed was very comfortable; great to have real shower; free internet; gym usage; staff (all friendly) and location. Negative: Lift noise; lifts slow and restaurant (there are so many great restaurants around - don't bother staying in) Would stay again!
1,0,This hotel is rather stupid to be frank. It's a horrible attempt to be retro-sheek but ends up looking similar to that Saturday Night live skit where things are so sheek that they are not functional. The rooms are about the size of a shoe box and there isn't much in them. I actually like the Pedestal in the bathroom but there is no sink. I had to put my make-up on using the toliet for 5-days. It also took me 10-minutes to figure out how to turn on the shower and the bathroom is more like a closet then anything. I had guests over one evening and everyone could hear everyone pee b/c the bathroom doors aren't doors at all and there is no bathroom fan! It was just over the top for me and lots of costruction nearby to keep you up at night. On a good note; the staff are really friendly and the place is really clean. That's about the only good thing I can say about this place. I would not go back.
1,0,My Husband and I did not enjoy stay at Hotel Allegro! The room was so small. The bathroom was ridiculously stupid; everytime you use the sink you would splash water on yourself. Truly one person at time in the bathroom; it was like being in an airplane's bathroom. The walls are so thin; we heard the people across hall having sex. The some staff were really rude. I did not appreciate it when we had a sign on the door saying do not disturb the day of our check out. Check out time is 11am or 12 and we got a know on the door at 8AM with the sign stating " do not disturb. " The hotel did not have any microwaves in their rooms; no mini fridge; and no coffee maker either. NO DRAWERS to put your clothes in and the closet was very very very tiny. We were there for four days and three nights; so we had three suit cases full of clothes and no places to store them at. I also hated the fact that we had to pay almost fifty to park our car. My Husand and I will never stay at Hotel Allegro again!!!
1,1,in the windy city ;this is a very good place.amazing rooms and service.everything is a walking distance .An absolute must for business trio as ease with which you can conduct and schedule meetings here is unbeatable. Good decor and impishly modern
0,0,My husband and I recently went to Chicago for my Aunt's funeral. We are not familiar with the area so we asked for recommedations of where to stay for the two nights we would be in town. We were told to stay at the Ambassador East Hotel. I wish we could say that our experience there was a good one; but sadly; it was one of of the more disappointing travel experiences we have had. Upon check in we were quickly shown to our rooms; but when we entered our king suite a very strong; musty smell greeted us on the other side. At first I thought I was just being sensitive; but after about an hour in the room we simply had to request to be moved. The smell was too overwhelming. The front desk said they would be happy to move us; but the only other room available was a suite with two double beds; rather than the king bed suite we originally reserved. While this was not exactly what we wanted; we didn't really have a choice to refuse. After transfering to the new room and getting settled; we discovered that the electrical outlet near the sink in the bathroom did not work. While this did not bother my husband too much; I was very annoyed; as I need the mirror while I use my hair dryer; curling iron; etc. I absolutely did not want to have to switch rooms yet again; so I simply had to make due with doing my hair next to the bed. They also only gave us two towels of any kind in the bathroom; so we had to request washcloths and small hand towels; BOTH DAYS we were there! Each time the housekeeping staff seemed incredibly annoyed at these requests. For what we paid to stay at this hotel; we were not impressed at all. The customer service was lackluster and the rooms were not up to par. If you are ever in Chicago; do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.
0,1,Great Hotel! The staff is friendly; corteous; and professional. They made me feel like I was a returning guest which I was not (but I will be!). The rooms were very clean and I slept well in the comfy bed. They have a complimentary workout deal with the nearby healthclub that I took advantage of several times since it was to cold to run outside. My only issue was the battery for the TV remote died. However; a call to the front desk remedied that situation in about 2 minutes! 5 stars!!!
0,0,I stayed at the InterContinental in Chicago for my visit to set up my Daughter's wedding. Nina (Our Daughter) stated this was the place where all the higher echilon gets hitched! Well I don't understand why at all. Upon arrival we checked in and met Nina at the "The Bar" (how innovative) and had a light supper. The food was like airline food and cold. The waiter was annoying and in your face when he could clearly see we were not ready to have our food taken yet. When he finally came with the check we thought "our light supper" was all too pricey. Then we were supposed to meet the sales manager Erin in the Lobby at 8:00 PM sharp. Not sharp enough. At 8:15 a worker came over to us and stated that Erin had an emergency and wouldn't be able to meet with us tonight. Well that is just great. Over $300 for a night and supper that would obviously be wasted. No more money will be spent here; I will Guarentee that. Sincerely Mr. and Mrs. Scott Grander Louisville; KY
1,1,We stayed 6 pleasent days in this not too big and very friendly hotel. the rooms were spotless comfortable and great view too... also nice view from the roof-bar. The area is pleasant nice and clean; minute walk to magnificant mile; easy to walk around to the lake. friendly stuff; very clean; great warm hotel to stay in. it does not have the "big hotel" factory-like feeling - more like home :)
1,0,My family booked five nitghts at the Omni Chicago for our upcoming spring break. We took advantage of a pre-paid; non-cancellable offer. We subsequently received a "Bed & Breakfast" offer via email and immediately called the hotel to inquire whether we could switch our reservation (same dates; different offer). We called the 800' number and the customer services representative was so obnoxiously condescending and ignorant; we simply hung up. We had been looking forward to our vacation; but now I am not sure I made the right choice with this hotel. I should have paid closer attention to the reviews - the Ritz; the Four Seasons; and the Peninsula would have never treated us this way. I will post again after our stay on April 17th.
0,0,I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel this past summer for 5 days and it was the worst hotel experience I have ever had! Firstly; the sheets that were on the bed seemed as if they were the same ones the previous guests had left on there; they looked dingy or just plain dirty. Second; I went to function one night and came back in late so I was really tired the next morning; hence I slept in late. I put the "Do Not Disturb" sign on my door and the room service still came knocking down my door asking if they can come and clean. Obviously; the room service lady can't read. Third; and worst of them all; when I checked I was only allowed valet parking so I gave up my keys hoping to get back my car in one piece. Well; the next morning when I asked for my car to be retrieved; there was a big dent in the driver's door of my 2010 Mustang! I was livid and the valet guy was insisting that he got it like that. In the end I had to get my door repaired on my own! The only thing I liked there was the food and it wasn't even all that. I was so disappointed and so I'm warning everyone to think twice before you make a reservation.
1,0,This hotel does not live up to the reviews. The room was larger than I expected. However; the decor was a bit dated. The bedding was ripped; carpet was stained; and the shower door was broken. There was a long wait to the elevators; and if you're on floors 2-6 you need to take a second elevator to get to the roof bar and gym. The main issue I had was the attitude I received from the staff. There was literally only ONE nice person at the front desk. There are no ice machines in this building; so you have to request it from the front desk. One day I requested it by going down to the desk and asking in person. 20 minutes later I made a follow up call because I did not receive my ice. I was nastily told that ice takes 10 minutes and I should just wait. I finally got the ice 10 minutes later. Two days later I requested ice again. Waited 30 minutes and just gave up. While I was leaving; I mentioned this to the woman at the front desk and she just said "I didn't get a call for ice." Well I obviously wasn't making it up; lady! I called and spoke with someone. She didn't even apologize or offer me anything. Overall; I would not recommend this hotel. There are so many hotels in the Chicago area. Choose a different one.
0,0,I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Conrad Chicago Hotel; located on North Rush Street. As part of the Hilton hotel chain; I was confident that I would have a positive experience. Unfortunately; from the time I walked in the door until the time I checked out; I was plagued with nothing but problems. When I walked into the hotel; I was not greeted by the concierge; which is usually a bad sign. (He was reading a newspaper.) Then; when I announced that I was holding a reservation; they desk clerk was unable to find it. I had a confirmation number which they agreed matched a number in their system; but they could not find the room I had reserved. Finally; they assigned me a room; but it was smaller than I had originally requested and it had a bad odor. I was very disappointed with the room and its decor. The room smelled of stale smoke; even though it was on a non-smoking floor. The bedspread was threadbare and there was no soap in the bathroom. I had to keep checking to make sure I was really at the Conrad Chicago. Surely; this was not the way the Hilton chain operates! There continued to be problem throughout my stay. I asked for a wake-up call and it was 15 minutes late; which had me scurrying around so I could make my business meeting. I ordered breakfast to be brought to my room; and it never showed up -- at all! And the water for my shower never reached anything by lukewarm; so my shower was short and unsatisfying. I decided to check out of the Conrad Chicago a day earlier than originally planned because I was so dissatisfied with the hotel and the way it attempted to resolve the problems and issues. Upon my return home; I wrote a letter to the hotel manager; but never received a reply. Because they refused to acknowledge that I had problems; I will not be staying at the Conrad Chicago again; and will avoid all Hilton Hotels in the future.
0,0,Millennium –I stayed at the Millennium in Chicago for a few days last month. Unfortunately; it wasn’t the luxury vacation I was hoping for. Things started off kind of rocky right from when I checked in. The hotel didn’t have my Hotwire reservation on record. Then when I ordered room service for dinner it took over an hour for them to deliver my food. Though the accommodations were pretty nice; it wasn’t worth the steep price I was paying for my suite.
0,1,Our experience at Hotel Monaco was wonderful. My fiancee and I stayed two nights in the Tranquility suite--absolutely exquisite! We had wonderful room service and practically never had to leave our room. (Except to go to the gym :) I was able to do yoga on the trip because they had yoga accessories in the room! I was surprised by that. This hotel was the definition of 'luxury'; they had anything we needed and more. My fiancee said we were staying at a really 'nice' hotel but I had no idea until we walked in the door. As soon as you walk in you are met with the charming atmosphere and luxurious decor. I have to admit; cheesy as it may sound; I felt like a queen all weekend long :) Most of the time I have at least one problem with the hotel I stayed at; but I have to say at this point I have no complaints at all about Hotel Monaco and I will definitely look forward to staying there again during my next trip to Chicago.
0,0,I visited the Hotel Allegro Chicago while I was on vacation with my daughter. I booked the room and was very excited because the website alludes to a very lavish interior with amenities far superior to the surrounding hotels. I was particularly excited there was a fitness center because I work out on a regular basis and I would not have to give that up on my vacation. Let me start by saying the staff was very rude and I was very dissappointed they could not respect that I was very tired after traveling a very long way. I booked the hotel stay for over a week; which was very expensive; and that seemed to not matter to them at ALL; despite that fact that I was travelling with a small child as well! They did nothing to accommodate me; and the woman at the front desk even refused rudely to take my calls or answer any questions about nearby restaraunts insisting that even though she worked there she "didn't know the area" To tope it all off; the fitness center was under construction so I never got to use it. Worst hotel experience of my life; I will never go back. - Sandy D.
0,0,The Hilton family would be outraged after hearing about a recent stay (i.e. nightmare) at the Palmer House Hilton. I arrived 3 days before the National Restaurant Association tade show hoping to beat the crowds and settle in for a long week of trade show business. When I arrived I was greeted or really snarled at by the Clerk. This lady (if one can really call this beast that) was aggressive and rude from the get go. She made a snide comment on the number of bags I had and it was downhill from there. My guaranteed and confirmed reservation had been mysteriously cancelled and she indicated that I had been the one to contact their call center seeking a cancellation. I informed "Brenda" that I had never cancelled my reservation. We had originally booked 2 rooms (one for me and one for colleague) and my colleague changed their reservation to come in one day later. She huffed and puffed and finally said; oh okay; I read it wrong but we don't have a room for you. My room had been given away to someone else that had arrived earlier that day. As a Hilton Honors member and someone that drops lots of money on this chain; I was furious. She said that perhaps someone else had found me a room at another hotel and to wait while she checked. She left the front desk and was gone for almost 20 minutes; coming back with a smirk on her face. She informed me that I had to make a decision and that both would not be satisfactory 100%. The first option was to stay at a hotel outside of the Chicago downtown; closer to the airport or that I could go with another room they had; a smaller smoking one with the potential but promise of an upgrade in 3 or 4 days. I was outraged. No; I'm sorry and certainly the options were horrible. I ended up taking the smoking room where I barely spent any time in it due to the strong cigarette smells. Additionally; there was no upgrade at all during my stay there. I was not offered anything to make up for my troubles; their screw-up nor did the hotel manager bother to return my call. The net outcome: I will NEVER stay at this hotel again and I'm thinking of shredding my Hilton Honors card. Don't make the mistake of dealing with this property. You will be very; very sorry. Thanks for reading all this. Hopefully it will help someone out there before booking at this joke of a hotel.
0,1,Great hotel!! The staff is very friendly and helpful. The room was in perfect shape; very clean and just a beautiful setup. I will definetly go to this hotel many more times when i am in the area! I would definetly recommend it!
1,1,Having booked the hotel directly with the hotel on its website; I arrived tired from Ireland; to find that they had mislaid my booking and had no room on that night; but did have rooms for the rest of the week. They booked me in to another (not as nice) downtown hotel and paid for my taxi to that hotel and for that nights accommodation. On my return to the hotel next day; I was upgraded to the Club level. What really impressed me was that the hotel did everything they could to make up for their earlier mistake...unprompted. Of course; the hotel itself (particularly on the 32nd floor) is excellent. I will definitely be back.
0,0,During my recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Chicago; I was severely disappointed in the quality of the facility and its staff. To start off; the rooms did not provide an adequate sound barrier between rooms. Hoping to spend a quiet evening after a long day of business meetings; I had hoped to spend a quiet night in. My neighbors; however; watching what I can only imagine was a Real House Wives of New Jersey marathon on full volume; destroyed my chance for peaceful ambiance. When I asked the concierge to address the issue; he seemed more concerned about his texting than doing his job. As I visited the gym; I found their "state-of-the-art" StayFitTM gym consisted in nothing more than a couple of treadmills; weights and yoga mats. The water in the cooler was quite warm; and the workout towels were stained and tattered. Finally; all the hypo-allergenic features touted on their website were rendered null by the presence of dust balls under the beds.
0,0,Hilton Chicago - I stayed at Hotel Hilton in Chicago in June last year; when I was on a holiday with friends. It was a very disappointing experience. We reached close to midnight and there was no one at the reception area to attend to us although we had pre-booked our rooms online a week before the arrival. We had to wait for almost an hour before we finally checked-in. The rooms were unkempt and the beds were not organized. It was shocking to find the sheets on the bed dirty and our request to get them changed was not answered for a couple hours. The television set in the room although was a latest model simply did not work. The bathroom attached along with the room was not up to the mark and looked unhygienic. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely not come back.
0,1,I accompanied my husband on a business trip to Chicago back in September and we stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel. The place was absolutely oozing with old-fashioned charm! Also; there were plenty of shopping opportunities within walking distance; so I shopped while my husband worked. It just doesn't get any better than that! I loved the service we received and the ambiance of that grand old hotel; and I'd definitely stay there again!
0,1,The Conrad Chicago was by far the best experience I have ever had in travel leisure. Not only was the room beautifully decorated and very comfortable; but the food in the restaurant was exquisite. Not to mention the perfect service from the resort's employees! I was very impressed by how quick and caring the staff was of my own personal needs. I'm naturally a fitness freak; so I was pleased to learn of their massive fitness area on the 11th floor. Best of all; it was available to guests at any time; day or night. The resort was conveniently located by a large shopping area; so it wasn't a far walk to scope out the shops. The most memorable part of my stay was looking out at the city after dark and seeing how gorgeous Chicago looks all lit up. It was so relaxing just watching the city come to life. I was very disappointed when I had to pack and leave. Any time that I make my way back to Chicago; you better believe I will be staying at the Conrad Chicago. I recommend this resort to everyone I know who does a lot of traveling.
1,0,This place is a dump. I booked on Priceline; because the last time I booked a Priceline hotel in Chicago; I got the Westin and loved it. Despite having paid for Priceline; I ate the money I had already spent and called for a reservation at the Westin and went there for the weekend; instead. I didn't regret it for a second. You will be disappointed if you stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker because you are paying for a Holiday Inn at the price of a Westin when you could have the real deal for just a little more. The location is not worth the place being old and so unimpressive. There are enough hotels near the loop (and near a train/bus stop if you need to move around the city inexpensively) that you should not spend the money on the Millenium. Do not waste your time and stay here--this is a trap because of its location; but it's not worth it. Really.
0,1,great hotel. went for the weekend with my wife and had a wonderful time. The hotel is one of the cleanest well kept hotels i have stayed at. Beautifull location on michigan ave downtown chicago overlooking grant park beautifull scenery. Great staff and wonderfull food as well; i would recomend this hotel for anyone who is looking for a nice vacation or going for work.
0,1,I was very satisfied after staying at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. The service was excellent; as the staff was very helpful and polite. The beds were very comfortable; and the rooms were very spacious. I will definitely be returning to this hotel.
1,1,My initial thought of the hotel was; this place is just ok; I didnt look up any reviews as I was staying there with 2 other friends. I was truly impressed from ceiling to floor with the room. Views were good; its just the surrounding buildings unless your towards the front where the river is located. I'm crazy about huge bathrooms and this one is HUGE. I love all the space they have. Flat tv; traditional seating and I admired the fabric-based headboards. Those are very nice! Walking distance to restaurants were convenient. I'm a highly frequent traveler to Chicago almost 20 years now and always stay with relatives. In any event; I'd recommend staying at the Monaco again!
1,0,I was very disappointed with the hotel this time. They seem to be coming down in quality quite a bit. The clientele also seem to be of a lower quality. The lobby was quite a rambunctious scene with no one on staff seeming to notice. The house keeper only did the bare minimum in the room each day and did not replace the used toiletries or the coffee; she also left the dirty coffee cups in the room. I think I will have to stay with the InterContinental next time.
1,1,I vacationed at the Fairmont Chicago for 3 nights in July 2009. The room; the bathroom; the view; and the staff were all wonderful. I just wish the hotel were a few blocks North (on MI Ave). Sometimes; when you're tired; that extra couple of blocks seem like miles!
0,1,I stayed at the the Conrad Chicago Hotel last winter with my family and I couldn't be happier with are choice. The staff was very polite and helpfull and the rooms were very comfortable and felt like home. I loved the area of chicago the hotel was in there wasnt alot of crim around and i felt safe being in a new city.
0,0,I would never stay here again. For a hotel that calls itself a four-diamond hotel; it cannot even provide the most basic amenities and services. I would have been more comfortable staying in a run-down motel. The bathroom had not been cleaned properly and the sheets were stained.
0,1,-Review of the Hard Rock Hotel- I find that the Hard Rock Hotel; located in Chicago; has extrodinary scenary. The hotel is extremely clean with shining furniture and the rooms are breathtaking. Hungry? Visit this hotel for yourself to see what excellence they provide at the dinner tables. The hotel also host events such as ballet; fun in the bar and a dj to name a few. This hotel is definitely worth your while. I will most definitely visit again. Book your reservation as soon as possible and don't forget your camera!
0,1,I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco and I must say; it has become one of my favorite hotels in the windy city. In the past; I've always stayed at the Marriott or the Hilton so this time I thought I'd go with a boutique hotel. I've stayed at some of the Kimpton properties in San Francisco so I was delighted that they are running the Monaco. Basically; I like the friendly; real-people atmosphere as opposed to the corporate style places I've used before. I do work out and they had a decent fitness center with the treadmill I normally use. South Water Kitchen served a terrific meal even in a city of great restaurants. I really dug the complimentary coffee; high speed internet and newspaper. I get tired of being nickel and dimed by the corporate hotels and liked the fact that the Monaco offered a bunch of freebies -- especially liked the afternoon wine service. All in all; I will return to the Monaco. It's a great alternative.
1,1,My wife and I stayed at this hotel at the end of May; 2009. She came for the weekend for a function and we extended the trip to take in the city. We got a deal on this hotel through TravelZoos. $249/night stay for $99/night plus we got the full buffet breakfast. The room was wonderful. Extremely large King size bed with expansive sitting area. We are used to smaller hotels with little room to move. The bed was extremely comfortable with lots of pillows. No wear or damage in room at all except sink tap dripped a bit (poor taps). We could have upgraded to river view for $20/night but chose not to. We enjoyed the room for what it was. 22nd floor looking south. The buffet breakfast was great. Lots to choose from and very fresh with made to order eggs; non stop coffee and juice and the servers were so eager to please. Great to have breakfast included in night stay. Might be a bit dear to pay at $22/person. It was nice to sit and relax with good breakfast; coffee and newspaper and not have to figure where to catch a morning meal. Concierge desk was most helpful in suggesting places to eat; always informative and ready to provide maps; directions; multiple suggestions and even make the reservations. Cards included to admit without paying cover charges at some jazz clubs. Location was great. Blocks from El and other transportation and easy walking distance to the parks and right on the river. If in Chicago again; would not hesitate to stay here again. A swimming pool would have been nice but we did not miss it.
1,0,We didn't stay in the hotel a lot because we went for the sites not the room. Saying that; we picked this hotel because it was the cheapest but the hotel not having any parking we spent money on parking our car than what we could have spent on a better more expensive hotel with parking. Hotel is great for guys getaway weekend that won't have a car. Not a family frienly hotel. Dining tip: Long walk from hotel Gino's pizza is a must have!! Worth the walk. Many things in between hotel and Gino's to do so you can break up the walk.
0,1,Talbott Hotel - Talbott hotel is like our home away from home. Whenever we visit chicago; we stay there only. It is close to Michigan Ave and the famed Water Tower. The price is an excellent factor considering the amenities provided. During our last stay; the staff was very helpful; they upgraded our room to king size considering our repetitive stay. The rooms are spacious; clean and bright. I would highly recommend Talbott.
1,1,What a fabulous hotel! From its location directly on the Magnificant Mile and surrounded by the finest shopping; to the curtious staff and excellent restaurants and bars; this hotel is one of the best in Chicago. Our room was very clean and fresh; the public areas comfortable and the staff at the concierge and front desk very extremely helpful. This is the only place to stay to be in the cnetre of the action in Chicago. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0,0,ï»¿Hilton Chicago- When we arrived at the Hilton Chicago we expected a reasonably nice chain hotel for our stay in Chicago. The price online seemed pretty reasonable and the location seemed to be pretty good. Oh were we wrong. We were nickled and dimed at every turn. Parking is ridiculous even for a city at $45 a day for self parking. They advertise free wifi  but read the fine print and realize that is only in the lobby or shell out a hundred extra for business class rooms. I felt like I was still in the airport being charged for every little thing. The hotel itself is the hotel equivalent of a McMansion: it tries hard to look like something high class but a second glance shows a somewhat pedestrian lobby space that has high vaulted ceilings and faux paintings to pretend to be a true luxury hotel. The room itself was reasonably sized; for a lower end hotel. When I am paying up for a Hilton I expect more than the bare bones. Our room had a view of an alley. When we asked to be switched to a lake view room we were told the upgrade would be an additional fee. They also say they are centrally located but central to what? The hotel is near Grant Park but any other part of the city is an L ride away at least. While the L is fantastic; a city like Chicago is best observed by walking; though it would be best if you avoid breaking a sweat or you will need to rinse off in the phone booth sized shower. Overall the Hilton provides a hardly passable experience where you will walk away feeling like your pocket was picked for a weak product.
0,1,I would first like to say how inviting the rooms themselves are. For my wife and I; we enjoy the warmer colors. Cleanliness along with excellent staff; made me feel away from home yet relaxed. Being right Downtown was perfect for location. The suites are very quiet as well. I surprised my wife with the "Shopping Package". What a hit! Thanks Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown !!
0,1,My stay at the Sofitel was great. I loved the location it was in. From the moment I arrived the experince was great; the attendants were helpful and the front desk was too. I thought the room was elegant and very clean as well as comfortable. The room service was excllent and they were very friendly. Checkout was a breeze and I couldnt ask for anything more in a hotel stay.
0,1,The Hilton Hotel helped us make the most of our trip to Chicago. Not only are they centrally located near most of Chi towns hot spots; but they also helped coordinate discounted admissions to various other attractions. The Hilton is very classy with their accommodations. I will be returning at my earliest convenience; be it for business or pleasure.
0,0,Fairmont - I was not impressed with this hotel. I have stayed at other hotels in the Chicago area in the past and Fairmont Chicago pales in comparison to those. Upon checking in; I noticed that the room had not been cleaned and only the bed was made. Also; the tables had cigarette burns on it. Upon inspecting the bathroom; I found out that the bathroom doors did not close properly. When I tried to get some work done; I had trouble with the spotty wi-fi because I kept getting disconnecting after every few minutes. While the bed was comfortable; I could not get much sleep due to the street-level noise of vehicles and people. I would not recommend this hotel at all and will definitely stay at another hotel the next time I'm in Chicago.
0,0,My wife and I live in the Western Suburbs of Chicago. For our anniversary; we booked a night at the Fairmont based on recommendations from friends. While the staff of the hotel was quite friendly and helpful and the location ideal for a night out in the city; the accommodations themselves were not up to our expectations. For starters; we requested a non-smoking room which we did receive. However; the hallway leading up to our room had a distinctive smell of smoke which certainly was a turn off for both of us. While the room was certainly adequate; the bathroom light had a distinct flicker and there was no complementary shampoo included. While the latter may seem like a minor offense; it is not what one expects from hotel of such reported quality. Finally; the cost of parking seemed to be somewhat inflated even for Chicago's standards. In summary; the Fairmont is a decent quality hotel but for the price; I am sure we could of done better.
0,0,James Chicago-I did not like my stay at the James. It was a bit too noisy on the lower floors (we were fourth; facing away from the lake); and the water pressure was not very good on the showers. The management did try to alleviate the situation with the showerhead; but they got to our request on the third day of our stay. The only plus was that the location was pretty good; we were by the Lake and a couple blocks northeast of the El. However; for the price; it was not worth it.
0,1,Allegro Chicago - When planning my last visit to Chicago; I looked at many hotels but quickly focused on the Allegro mainly because I felt that a 4 star hotel for under $200 a night was a very good deal. And; after having spent a couple of nights there; I can assure you it is. It was a leisure trip; half to spend time with friends and half to see how the city had changed in the last 2 years since I visited it and so I wanted to try to get a separate living suite so my friends (who don't live in the downtown area) could spend more time with me. Choosing the King Suite at the Allegro made this trip a lot easier and more fun. The separate living suite allowed me to spend more time with my friends after we had hit the bars and clubs; and they could actually spend the night in my room comfortably. This wasn't possible in pretty much all the other hotels I've stayed at. Apart from that; the hotel is of pretty standard quality as far as 4 star hotels go; and I couldn't tell you much about the location since I like to walk about cities. However; the separate living area in a 4 star hotel all for under $350 was a great deal; rooms like that usually go for hundreds more.
0,0,I stayed two nights at the Hilton Chicago. That was the last time I will be staying there. When I arrived; I could not believe that the hotel did not offer free parking. They wanted at least $10. What am I paying for when I stay there for the night? The website also touted the clean linens. The room was clean and I believe the linens were clean. The problem was with all of the down pillows etc. Don't they know that people have allergies? I also later found out that this hotel allows pets. I think that this was another part of my symptoms. If you like a clean hotel without having allergy attacks I suggest you opt for somewhere else to stay. I did not like how they nickel and dimed me in the end for parking. Beware hidden costs. I will try somewhere else in the future. Not worth the money or the sneezing all night.
1,0,I want to issue a travel-warning to folks who might sign up for the weekend deal they offer through travelzoo from time to time: The deal says "free breakfast" included in the price. However; what they don't tell you; is that the breakfast consists of a cup of coffee and a bisquit (or two)! Moreover; you need to ask for these "tickets" at the lobby when you check in - they won't give them to you automatically! We stayed there over Christmas '03; and we; and I noticed several guests who bought the same package; had a rather unpleasant experience! The hotel is nice though; if you don't consider their lousy service!
1,0,I would not recommend this hotel. Although it is in a good area; the room was very small and is getting rather dated. The room had extensive damage. The paint on the bathroom ceiling was peeling. The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling. The wood work in the bathroom looked like it had been chewed on. There was mold and stains on the bathroom tile. The room was very small. There was not room for a sofa. Just a small faded chair and ottoman. The carpet had stains on it. Also; the bed was comfortable; but there was not a top sheet; just the bottom sheet and a comforter. Overall I was not satisfied with the hotel for the price that was charged. I have stayed in other hotels in the area that provided much more space; cleanliness; and value for the money paid.
0,0,My husband and I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for three nights last month. We were celebrating our anniversary; so we decided to splurge on the Prestige Suite. According to the website; we were to be given either a city or park view; neither of which we had. Instead; our room was overlooking a dirty field with some sparse trees. The woman who checked us into our room was rude and impatient; and the man who helped with our bags was the same. When we got to the room; the beds were unkempt and the floors were in serious need of a vacuuming. The bathroom was dirty and there was dried toothpaste in the sink. My husband requested that we be given another room; preferably a clean one; but the clerk told us that there were no other rooms available. If given the chance; I would not stay at this hotel again; even if I were offered a free night.
1,0,We stayed 2 nights over spring break in what was called a Jr Suite but resembled a wide hallway with a window at one end. Bad cheap furniture; carpet that stops short of reaching the wall; a TV that sticks out into the middle of the room and a window that whistled when the wind blew. BAD BAD experience. Find aother hotel plenty in the area.
1,1,I was completely blown away by this hotel. It was magnificent. I got a great deal and I am so happy that I stayed here. Before arriving I was nervous as I had read a few bad reviews about the impact the renovation was having on peoples stay; for example very noisy. However; whilst the renovation was still going on and the gym was not open nor the restaurant; it made no difference to me. My room was huge; bathroom was spacious with excellent water pressure; bed was perfect and the view was amazing. Hotel is so close to the great shops of Magnificent Mile; plus a comfortable walking distance to Hancock tower and Millennium Park.
1,0,I stayed at the hotel during the Dave Matthews Caravan tour and would come home each night rather dusty/dirty from being at an outdoor concert with 200;000 of my closest friends. I used half a bottle of shampoo the first night. The second night; the staff had not refreshed my bar soap or shampoo. I informed the front desk who made apologies and said they would take care of it immediately. I got home that night with a tiny tiny bar of soap (hand soap) for the bath/shower and they had replaced the shampoo in its original place; nicely displayed; but with the EXACT SAME bottle of shampoo that was now 1/8 full. Yeah!! The hotel is in a great location to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave....I'll grant them that....but that's where their "pros" end. I'd rather stay at a Hampton Inn. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
0,1,I really loved my stay at the Talbott. My room was amazing! The bathroom (and I am VERY picky about hotel bathrooms) had ample room for all of my stuff; which is a bonus for me. The staff treated me really well and they were very friendly. I was afraid that I'd get a little lost; since it was my first trip to Chicago; but the staff helped me navigate to the downtown area (Rush St./Michigan Ave.-- which are *very* close by). The hotel reminded me of those I'd stayed at in Europe. The room service is 24 hours; which for me; was a bonus because I am up mostly during the nights. This is the *only* place I will ever stay if I visit Chicago again. For a single woman traveling alone to a strange city; this hotel made me feel very safe and comfortable.
1,1,a great hotel; we used the CTA the 2 days we were in Chicago and it is great; that the Line 6 stops nearly in front of the hotel. So we did not need any taxi and traveled from Midway to the city and to Ohare for 9$ and we used the buses alot (freezing cold). The hotel itself is great; very clean rooms; realy on of the best bathrooms i ever had. Staff very friendly; they even found me out were i can get Timerland shoes.... and she was right i got them in one place she told me... thats service...I also was having a look to the gym room and the swimming pool area; did not use it and I do not know if it would have been included in the room price....but realy a nice view makes running easyer....
0,1,What a gorgeous hotel! From the moment we stepped inside the warm colors of the lobby made us feel welcome at the Sheraton and in Chicago. The heavenly beds made the view from our room that much better; and to top it off with great restaurants; you couldn't ask a hotel for more! Starbucks coffee in the rooms were just an extra touch that guarantees we'll be back every time we visit Chicago.
1,1,We arrived at 10:30 am on a Friday; and they had a room ready for us by 11:30 am; mind you check in is not until 3:00pm. We got our room on Priceline for $65.00 per night and stayed 3 nights. We were upgraded - for free - to a suite. I think I was so blown away by that; that I forgot to thank them at check-in! Our room was fantastic. It also had a wet bar and a fridge. The bathroom was quite large and had a nice sized closet with many hangers. I knew from previous reviews to not touch the mini-bar. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The room was very clean. Every employee there went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. We stayed on the 25th floor of the east tower and had a quiet room. Yes; you could hear people in the hallways; but only because they were rude and were yelling. These were not children; they were adults. I don't know why everyone complains about $48 for parking. This is Chicago and every other hotel we saw charged just as much; some without in/out privledges. We didn't use any of the restaurants or the health club. We tried to eat at the Corner Bakery but it was too crowded. Breakfast at nearby Houlihan's had a buffet for $9.99 per person. Also the grocery store behind the hotel is great. There is a 7-11 not too far away. I don't know why there are so many bad reviews on this hotel. Yes; it's a big hotel. If you don't want a busy lobby; don't stay in a 2;000 plus room hotel!! I loved the Hotel and would recommend it to anyone. Not one problem. Wasn't too busy for me. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.
0,1,I just got back from the Monaco in Chicago! I was very pleasantly surprised; as my husband booked this trip as a last minute getaway; and he usually picks bad places-haha. Anyway; the moment we got there the doormen greeted us warmly and helped get our luggage situatated. It was busy and the line was a little long; but it moved quickly. The lady at the front desk gave us a high floor when we requested one which was very good; especially since it seemed to be near full. The room was clean and spacious (especially considering it's a city hotel). We made a lot of use of the concierge; since again; it was so last minute we didn't really make any plans. He gave us some tips and also gave us a few places we should go for Chicago pizza yummy! It was also great being near the theater district; and basically in the thick of everything so we saved on cab fare. I thought the coolest thing was they brought you a goldfish in a bowl for your room! very trendy. My husband is not as easily impressed; but he was really excited about the free wine hour and the free drinks in the afternoon. Overall; really nice stay in a four star; or probably four and half star hotel!
1,1,This hotel was great - In a great area right downtown and close to everything. The daily happy hour had great food; wine and premium liquors. The free breakfast was even better! Actually I believe everything was included breakfast/happy hour/business center/WiFi. Our room was a king size facing the back of the building. Really clean new and comfortable. Small touches such as books and cds to enjoy made the room feel less like a hotel - Would highly recommend.
1,1,After reading the reviews on this hotel; I decided to book my stay for July 4th weekend here and I am glad I did; this hotel is absolutely beautiful. Our suite was gorgeous it is a very romantic hotel with big sit in picture windows. I do have 1 complaint. The bar is very boring and the resturant is not that great; but other than that I loved it. I would definitely stay there again.
0,1,This hotel was incredible! Haven't had a better stay in a hotel in my life. I will definitely come here again next time I am in Chicago! The rooms were so elegant; with their modern color schemes. The staff members were friendly and willing to lend a hand. The beds were surprisingly comfortable; with interesting covers. The TVs were HD; which was a step up from most hotels i have stayed at before. There was a cool martini bar that I spent an hour at one night; which was enjoyable; especially because of the live jazz band
1,1,My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend and it was great. The check-in staff changed our room to a single bed without question; and the bar served the best martini I have had in a while. The rooms were well decorated and spacious; although it did get a little tight through the bathroom door. The bell staff was very accomodating and walked my wife up to our room when she arrived late. I would definitely stay here again!
1,1,If you are looking for a hotel that is truly in the best location; the Intercontinental is it--right on the Magnificent Mile; next to the Chicago River; across from the Wrigley Building. My daughter and I stayed here for a getaway; and quickly were able to get to Milennium Park; shopping; Navy Pier; great dining; exploring festivals and strolling through beautiful areas along the lakefront and Chicago River. Check-in was easy and we were treated with courtesy throughout our stay. Maria; one of the concierges; was especially helpful in finding us a unique place to eat. The room was lovely and comfortable; although our tub didn't drain well. Just a wonderful stay!
1,0,I've used Priceline for every trip I've made back to Chicago and I've been fortunate to have stayed in some excellent hotels downtown. This was my first and last stay at the Ambassador East. Its conveniently located near the Clark/Division stop on the El's red line. That is the best part of our experience. When we checked in we were charged additional for upgrading from a king bed to two queens. I've never had that issue at any other hotel I've stayed at. The room's decor was outdated and the TV was tiny. The hotel charges for usage of Internet. You could hear people in the hallway and when you're in the hallway you could easily hear people in the rooms. We weren't in Chicago to stay in the hotel however; for people that might want a romantic weekend this definitely isn't the place. ...read more
1,1,I stayed at the Palmer House for @ $150/night on a corporate rate. The bed was excellent; the linens/towels were top of the line. I did not find my room shabby; as other reviewers noted. The Palmer House is over 130 years old. Rooms have older woodwork and classic furniture; I think that lends to the ambience of the place. It is expensive; and I'm not sure I'd stay there if my company weren't picking up the tab. But the hotel itself is still awe-inspiring.
1,1,We booked our room on Priceline; and got a good deal at around $100 per night. We stayed for the first 2 nights of our US trip so didnt use too many of the hotel's facilities The hotel is centrally located; just over the Chicago River from the shops at North Michigan Avenue; and around a mile from Navy Pier Our room was clean and comfortable; and on the 29th floor we had a good view of the city; and could just about see Lake Michigan (though the weather was very bad). The layout of the room is a little peculiar; with the bed facing away from the window; but over all we have no complaints about this hotel; and unlike some other reviews we were not disturbed at all by noise from other guests So; pros and cons: Pros: Helpful and friendly staff Clean and comfortable throughout Spacious rooms Large and airy public areas Starbucks and gift shop in lobby Cons A large hotel; so a long walk from the elevators to the front desk / lobby area
1,0,I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in mid-March and was so disappointed with everything. The room was small; the carpets in the looby were smelly; no bathtub in the washroom and view of brick walls from the windows. Not even free internet which even the cheapest hotels offer these days. It costs $10/day to connect to internet. If you want to use internet in the lobby; minimum charge is $5 per use. To use the phone in the rooms for local calls; it is $1.25/15mins and then 10 cents every min. Even the local calls are charged; what a rip off!!! Every hotel I have stayed at offers free intercontinetal breakfast; of course no such thing at this hotel. No indoor pool; go figure. I won this from bidding process at priceline; I will be reluctant to use this service and this hotel in future.
0,1,the experince at the hard rock hotel in chicago was fantastic;i will rate them a 6 out of 5. they have wonderful service and great staff and the view is just wonderful.
0,0,First off; don't get a room on a lower floor; the garbage pick up makes a ton of noise and wakes you up at 6 am. Then don't bother going down for breakfast at that time either; because the restaurant isn't open that early. When it finally opened; the breakfast arrived cold and late. Nothing like congealed eggs to start your day. The fitness center had no towels and no cups for water. It was also too hot and too many people had sweated too much in it. After my congealed breakfast; it really was not pleasant. My entire three day visit was like that. I tried room service that night; but again; service was very slow and the food not warm when it arrived. My high speed internet was not so high speed when it would connect me at all. The furniture was run down and worn. Pool towels were not always available. Generally; for the price I paid; I would expect better service and a better maintained premises.
0,0,Chicago has many wonderful luxury hotels for tourists and business travelers. When visiting the Windy City; however; the Conrad Hotel and Resort is one to avoid. While the description promises clean accommodations; luxury amenities; and "deep soaking tubs;" in relity; the rooms fall short of expectations. I opened the door to my suite to find a musty smell in the room similar to that of an old neglected closet. A bit disappointed; I decided to ignore this fact. Hoping to take a nice long soak after my travels; I made my way to the bathroom. While I did find a large; deep bathtub; there was a hard water stain giving it a dingy look. Hardly what I expected for the price I paid for the accommodations. In the corner of the bathroom; I found a reminder of a pevious guest; a clump of blond hair. The maid service seemed to be lacking. Not to be deterred from enjoying my stay; I decided to watch television on the 42 inch flat screen I had been promised. Unfortunately; the battery to the remote control was dead. I called the front desk; at my wits' end; to complain about the issues; but was greeted by a desk clerk with a very sassy attitude who seemed to doubt my every word. Overall; I would definitely not recommend the Conrad Hotel and Resort in Chicago. My room was dirty; the staff was unfriendly; and the ammenities were few and far between. On my next stay in Chicago; I will definitely stay elsewhere.
1,0,this is my letter to the management..... Sir or Madam: I am writing to give feedback about our recent stay the Amalfi. We were a guest from 11/20 to 11/23. During our stay we used the "Valet" Service operated through Standard Parking. Our vehicle was returned with stolen items from the glove compartments. Much to my chagrin; $44/day valet service did not include proper security/monitoring; despite the premium over "self park". I understand that these parking services are sub-contracted by the hotel; but I would think that any worthy hotel would remedy the situation. This was not the case. I hope that your staff will be able to take measures to rectify the situation for future guests
0,0,Conrad Chicago;"This hotel has a mediocre service. We ordered for room service and it arrived very late and there wasnâ€™t an apology also. The room had no coffee maker and we had to make a trip to the restaurant to have coffee or tea. The Internet service was free but it didnâ€™t make any difference as it was so slow that I used my personal internet dongle to browse the web. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
0,0,My husband and I recently stayed at the Conrad Chicago for three nights; a Thursday through Saturday. Let me say we were less than pleased with our experience. We chose to stay in the "King Bed Deluxe Room" and for an average of over three hundred dollars a night we were sorely disappointed with the accommodations. Upon entry the room looked as though it had not been cleaned thoroughly; the rug looked dirty and there were crumbs or something on the dresser. The room was size was average; and again for three hundred dollars a night we were expecting a almost suite type room. The major annoyance was how loud people were. We came in after midnight each evening and long after we went to bed we could hear people coming down the hallway yelling and running. That is totally unacceptable for a supposed high end hotel. You can expect a loud guest maybe once; but every night is ridiculous. The service was also extremely sub par. We had to wait 20 minutes at check in because the girl at the counter was too busy talking to another employee about what she was going to do after work. One day we put the no house cleaning sign on the door and a maid literally walked in on me. She completely disregarded the sign; did not even bother to knock and just unlocked the door and came right in. It scared me and I'm just glad I was not getting out of the shower or changing. So to sum up; we will never stay at the Conrad again; we will never recommend it to anyone else; and for the money there are a hundred much better hotels to stay at in Chicago.
1,0,Wow. Here is a place to NEVER hold an event. First; no one smiles; including the bartenders. Doesn't anyone here know they are in the HOSPITALITY business? The bartender was 54 years old. Why do I know that? Because; she stated to another employee that "when you get to be 54 years old; you tell it like it is." Very specifically; she was referring to the fact that she could tell her employers how they should run things. Wow. The room was set up the wrong way for the event. The food was just plain bad. $9 at a Ponderosa would have been as good. However; this is the Swisshotel. Oh; let's go back to the bartender telling us; unsolicited; about all the problems with the hotel. Man; you just have to wonder how a place like this stays in business. $50 for valet. Ouch. Anyone asking you if you need something; like help? No. Does management make excuses? You bet. Do you ever want to hold an event here? Big no.
0,1,I would like to add a comment; maybe this will help others when choosing for a wedding destination. My daughter was married in May of 2010 and we decided to have the special event at the Sofitel Water Tower; we were amazed. She always wanted a ballroom type of wedding; and Sofitel made this happen for her. They took care of all the invitations; cake decor; and so much more. The special day for my daughter was worth everything. If you are going to be in the Chicago area; check them out; you will not regret it!
0,0,I had an awful experience here. The staff were rude and unhelpful. It took forever to check in and when I did; they took a while to even find my reservation. When I got to the room; it was marginally clean and when I complained; they said they were full and could not do anything for me. I would never go back. They are obviously not worried about customer service.
0,0,This hotel was very overpriced for what you get from staying here. The Amalfi Hotel Chicago advertises itself as a "luxury hotel" located in downtown Chicago. Since it is in downtown Chicago; that means that I had street noises keeping me up most of the night. My view also suffered. They had nicer rooms available with better views; but the markups to stay in them was outrageous! The room itself was decent; with clean linens and nice air conditioning; but I can get that in just about any hotel these days. There wasn't anything particularly luxurious about the hotel to make it a stand-out for me; but for the price I paid for the room; I certainly had that expectation. It was a let down.
0,0,Affinia Chicago is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. Not in my life have I been treated so poorly as a guest. The front desk was very unaccommodating when I asked for a smoke free room when they had made an error in my reservation. There was no bellhop available for some strange reason so I had to move all my luggage to the elevator and down a long hallway to my room by myself. If it wasn't already a bad stay; I ordered room service and it took over an hour and a half to be delivered. If they didn't have air conditioning in the room; I would say just about everything about this stay was completely miserable. If you are traveling to Chicago for any kind of business; I hope you decide not to choose this hotel. I was quite surprised; I like Chicago as a city but this stay definitely made my trip quite a negative experience.
0,0,Palmer House A Hilton Hotel – I was hesitant at first to book a room at the Palmer House; but I decided to give it a try. Though it was a high class hotel; I did not find my stay to be worth the price I paid. My room was not much better than any other average hotel I have stayed at before. It was a pretty small room especially given the high cost. The food served at the Lockwood Restaurant was nothing special. Also; I thought it was outrageous that I had to make a reservation in order to go to the bar; especially since I am a paying guest at the hotel. In the end; I thought the Palmer House is a nice hotel but definitely not worth the amount of money I paid for my stay.
0,0,I recently stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago with my wife. I was on business but I thought I'd take her so we could see the city as well. Chicago was great; The Allegro...not so much. I mean it looked nice; great lobby and all. The service wasn't so great though. The clerk was a younger girl who seemed a bit rude. Like we were bothering her and interrupting her day by wanting to book a weekend. The bell hop took our bags to our room; none to gently. My wife and I watched as he threw our luggage on the floor in our room. Which wasn't that bad till he actually asked for a tip! Our room was okay. The bed was sort of rough and made a odd plastic rubbing noise every time you moved. The next day my wife went out and returned to find our room wasn't cleaned. Our trip to the Chicago had it's nice moments; all outside the hotel. The Hotel Allegro seemed like they spent too much on the appearance and neglected to staff it better. I won't stay there again.
0,0,This hotel is overpriced. One should pay money for luxury; but they fall far short considering the prices that they charge. When you go to the hotel restaurants you expect a certain mark-up because; yes; they do have to make money. But the prices they charge for food that was okay makes little sense to me. When I got there and went to my room; I thought that there would be nice colors; a great view; and deluxe bedding. What I got were sheets that might have come from the full price section of target--they were not cheap; but not that expensive either. I think I could have found something of this quality at less than the 200ish a night I paid.
1,1,We stayed 2 nights at the Knickerbocker and could not have had a better stay. The hotel has recently renovated there rooms. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful from Dave and Cora at the martini bar to Julie at the front desk who help out with an upgrade for us. The hotel has everything you need for your stay and is close to all the fun that Chicago offers. Our pick for THE CITY is the Knickerbocker. JOHN and JUDY.
0,1,My husband and I stayed in the Hilton Chicago and had a very nice stay! The rooms were large and comfortable. The view of Lake Michigan from our room was gorgeous. Room service was really good and quick;eating in the room looking at that view; awesome! The pool was really nice but we didnt get a chance to use it. Great location for all of the downtown Chicago attractions such as theaters and museums. Very friendly staff and knowledgable; you cant go wrong staying here.
0,0,The Intercontinental Chicago was not as great an experience as I was expecting it to be. When I first arrived the front desk staff could not find my reservation in the system. They then tried to make me book a higher paying room. I ended up having to ask for the manager; who conveniently was able to locate a room for me with the same rate. I was expecting top notch service and class but apparently those services are reserved for the elite. I was not doted on as I should have been and found that I had long wait times when I placed an order with room service or needed the concierge. For the price I was paying to stay there I would have thought there would have been more of a catered and personal touch to the service.
1,1,Mostly great with a few islands of relatively minor problems. First the good: Outside of the hotel and lobby were decorated like a winter wonderland; as befitted the season. The restaurant service was absolutely flawless ( servers who don't write orders because they are expected to remember them; remember clients clearly from one day to the other; and go above and beyond consistently). Rooms are comfortable: yes the beds are great! The gym is well equipped. Second the slightly off putting: mmmhh...we got the "I love chocolate package" which advertized: bfast every day; dinner once; snack once and...a gift. And we have an A-Club favorite guest membership; which also advertized " a gift". So; no gift...either for the chocolate package or the favorite guest membership. Upon enquiry; "the snack was the gift". Not at all what the package suggested. That said; bfast was sublime and the chocolate dinner outstanding as well. Some problems at checkout though: we got charged for all dining despite having booked the package and it took quite a while for a polite but seemingly less than informed front desk staff to correct the problem. Would absolutely go back; but probably not on a special package.
0,1,Stayed here for two nights and really enjoyed the stay. The cost was a little bit more than I usually care to spend; but turned out to be a great value. Location was walking distance to restaurants and the subway. Really close to the Miracle Mile and Millennium Park. Room was large; cozy; and beautiful- especially loved the window seats with a great view of the river. Complementary wine hour and a goldfish in the room made this a special experience!
0,0,When I arrived at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I was shocked at the poor and dangerous neighborhood it was situated in. This was not the Chicago I was hoping for.In addition to that; it looked nothing like it did in the pictures on their website. The paint was faded and chipped; there was a foul odor in the lobby and there was no staff to speak of. After we waited for 15 minutes at the front desk; someone finally came and said that they did not have a reservation under our name. After a long trip; I'm sure you know how aggravating that was. Finally I got a manager that knew how to work the computer properly and he brought up our reservation. Once we got to our room; it was very small; smelled like smoke and the carpet was severely stained with either wine or blood. Also; as we were walking to the room in the hallway; a cockroach walked right across our path like he owned the place. To top it off it seemed everyone staying at the hotel was a gangster or a gambler and his lady for the night. All we heard was lots of frighteningly loud love making and arguments ensuing that even a television could not mask. It was a nightmare. Oh yeah; and the shower did have any hot water. We complained to the desk and they said that it was not there fault and that it would be fixed my next week. When we asked for a discount they said that there were no refunds and that we could leave whenever we wanted.
1,1,Spent a wonderful night at the Amalfi with friends. The evening reception was very nice and the staff was very attentive. Breakfast was a plus; rooms were cozy and very clean. Would not hesitate to go back again.
0,1,Let me just preface this by saying that I absolutely loved my stay at this hotel. I chose it largely for location as I don't really love to walk that much and I was incredibly pleased with its situation in the city. It was just a couple blocks away from several museums and shopping districts but my husband and I mainly ventured out for food; of which there were great options and the concierge was a great help. We had originally booked the King Guestroom but upon arrival were upgraded to the Deluxe King Guestroom by the front desk. Everyone was remarkably friendly and helpful which is something I look for and remember when I go to stay in a location again. Our room was amazing. Seriously amazing. It was so chic and I just loved the headboard over our bed. There wasn't one little spot of dust to be found. The bathroom was gorgeous and we made full use of the two bathrobes in the closet. We didn't take anything from the snack bar but it all looked delicious. We had dinner at David Burke's Primehouse. I cannot recommend the NY Ribeye more highly. It was fantastic. For dessert we had the brown butter corn cake. I've been trying to replicate that dish ever since I got home. I'm sad to say that I didn't get a chance to try any of the treatments at Spa by Asha but I definitely will make a point to on my return visit. The James Chicago made our trip to Chicago memorable. The staff was friendly; the hotel beautiful; and the food delicious. What more could you want?
0,0,I have been stayed in Allegro for two days. There are not other big prolems but one thing I'm not satisfied with is the light. It is dark in the room. Also in the bathroom; the light is not good. I have to open curtains. I have complained about this to their reception. They said they will fix it; but I did not get any response. I am very disappointed and I will never come back again.
1,0,Thank god I got this hotel through priceline. I can't imagine paying full price for this place. The tub was moldy and dingy. The toilet didn't flush. Their selection of TV channels was limited to say the least. Unless you wanted to pay $5 for a rerun of an NBC show. Oh; and internet? Why that will set you back about $15 for the day. And breakfast? That's about $16 for a cup of coffee; a croissant and two slices of honeydew. This hotel is the pits. The customer service is....absent! When you walk in to the ridiculous lobby (decked out like some bad late 80's prom) there's no one to direct you upstairs to the check in. And once you're there; check in is very fast; i'll grant them that. This hotel is a big; crummy rip-off. I will never stay here (and will steer clear of Hyatts in general I believe).
0,0,The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is a nice place to stay if you need a place to stay on quick notice; but it certainly does not "exceed expectations" as touted on their website. Their Starpoints system is somewhat complicated and not helpful for the frequent traveler. "Chic but not fussy" is an overstatement. The room was clean; although the bed covering was wrinkled and the bathroom counter had water lying on it that appeared as though it hadn't been cleaned since the last guest. There was hand lotion and shampoo samples; but no soap sample. The bathroom was short on two towels and it took two calls to housekeeping to get this fixed. "Cheap" might have been a better adjective. Check out was simple and not much hassle. Overall; the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is fine in a pinch; but next time; I will research hotels a little better before making a decision and reserving a room.
1,1,We live down the block from the hotel. We arranged to have new floors put in our condo while we were away. The floors were not finished when we returned so we looked for an inexpensive local hotel for one night. I think the Ambassador East was the least expensive hotel within a reasonable distance so we decided to stay there. Over the years I had had some visiting groups stay there. I had also eaten there and been to the bar but I had never stayed there myself. The lobby is elegant. The service is great and the room was large and clean although a little outdated. The location is the best residential area in the city (as far as I am concerned -- I live two blocks away) and it is very convenient to North Michigan Avenue ( a good shopping street) and reasonably convenient to the Loop ( the main business area) There are also probably 50 restaurants in all price ranges in reasonable walking distance including some of the best in the city. I paid less than $100 including tax for one night. I am not sure what their regular rates are but I think my deal was the best travel bargain around.
1,1,My wife and I stayed two nights at the Talbott at the end of February. This little hotel was the perfect place for us. The lobby is very small but also cozy; and with both fireplaces going it was a welcoming atmosphere coming in from the cold. The staff was very friendly and efficient. The room was pretty spacious; and the king bed was extremely comfortable. We had a seventh floor room facing delaware st; so there was really no view. The bathroom was a good size; including two sinks and a spacious tub/shower. There was also free wireless internet...a big plus for us. Perhaps the best thing about the Talbott is the location. We were only a few steps from State; Rush; and North Michigan. Tons of shopping; bars; and good food are easily within walking distance. This makes the Talbott a great place for tourists who want to walk around and take everything in. We highly recommend the Talbott; and will gladly stay again on return trips.
0,0,Me and my business associate had a job in Chicago and wanted to stay somewhere that had more features. We did some research online and came across the Hotel Moncaco. We decided to stay for 3 nights. When we arrived we noticed that it was in a busy part of the city with bright lights. The staff was upstiff; and didn't not offer much hospitality. Our room did have a view; but of the city lights and kept our room bright; even with the curtains closed. The beds appeared soft; but did not offer much comfort. For what we paid; we expected more.
1,1,Our third stay at the Homewood Suites Chicago proved to be just as great as the previous two. The staff are consistently friendly; polite and professional - and this applies whether they are working at the front door; servicing the rooms; managing the breakfast room or on the reception desk. They genuinely seem happy to be working here and can't do enough for their guests. The rooms are large and clean and seem to have good insulation from each other (we didn't hear a thing from our neighbours and the hotel was quite busy). The hotel is well placed for walking to the shops on Michigan Ave; or catching a bus or subway. There is a Jewel Osco and a Trader Joes each within a couple of blocks; which are perfect for stocking up on groceries etc. My husband heartily recommends 'Binnies Beverage Depot' for a huge variety of beer. Now all we need is an excuse to return to Chicago next year - then we can make it four years on the run at the Homewood Suites; because we wouldn't stay anywhere else!
0,0,While the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago promises upscale accommodations and a unique experience; they fail to deliver. Unless of course; a unique experience includes being kept awake all night by a party in the room next door. If you plan on staying there for a chance to meet your favorite celebrity or musician you will be sorely disappointed. The "A" list celebrities will not be there. In fact; it would be rare to find anyone on the "B" list either. The party that keeps you awake will not be your favorite band practicing for their next concert. The party is being held by the musicians that were not even able to gain work at a local coffee bar. The walls of the rooms are so thin you can hear every wrong note played. As for the promise of Art Deco; it must have changed in definition. Your room will truly look like a concert has just been held. The carpet smelled like it had been shampooed in beer. The bathroom lets just say that clean was not the correct description. Quality service and amenities were severely lacking. Guests are not greeted with warmth but with disdain. Do not bother complaining about the noise next door either. It is part of you unique experience. The only part of the Hard Rock Hotel description that appeared to be accurate was that it is in a great location in Chicago. It was easy to find a real hotel to stay in for the rest your trip.
0,1,The atmosphere at this hotel is truly remarkable; it has a very modern feel. The rooms were very well designed; and the beds are not your average hotel room beds by any means. The pillow top beds made an already relaxed and comfortable stay that much more enjoyable.
0,0,We planned a fun time for our kids this summer by booking a kids suite at the Swissotel Chicago. Our fun time was not exactly that. Upon arriving for our weekend getaway; we find that the reservations we made online and the confirmation we held in our hand for a kids suite; did not mean a thing. Apparently; there were none of the kids suites available. The kids suite is supposed to have things to keep the kids happy when they are in the room: coloring; video games; etc. No one at the front desk could explain to us why there were no kids suites available. Whatever. So; we took a regular suite with the promise that we would be moved as soon as one became available. Guess what? We spent the whole weekend in the same room. Yes; the staff apologized; but no one seemed overly concerned that our children were dissapointed and no compensation or extras were offered to make us less cranky about it. Other than that and the fact the none of the hotel staff was very friendly; the rooms were clean. We did not spend a lot of time in the hotel; but I will not be booking a room here again. The staff did not impress me at all and we did not feel like we were treated well at all.
0,1,Conrad Chicago;"I stayed in this hotel when I went to Chicago for vacation and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The ambience in the bedroom was way better than the other hotels that I have visited. The bathroom was spacious and had a big tub. They had separate commode room as well. Too bad the hotel didnâ€™t have a spa or a pool. They provide free in-room internet service which is a plus. The Terrace restaurant was decent but it didnâ€™t have much vegetarian options. The concierge was very helpful in recommending the places to visit nearby. The hotel is located at a perfect place in the middle of Magnificent Mile; very close to Michigan Ave which has a lot of wonderful shops. All in all a very good stay and worth the money I paid."
0,0,The Affinia in Chicago obviously caters to wedding guests and corporations hosting business conferences. If you do not represent one of these groups with a large number of guests and revenue for Affinia; do not expect any measure of customer service and don't expect great accommodations; even at their high prices. When we arrived our reservation was lost; then it took forever for the concierge to tell us the room we were instead given was available. The furnishings in the room were cheaply made; the cleaning obviously superficial and our view was directly into the concrete wall of the hotel's L shaped corridor. I called for fresh linens and toiletries and a very rude phone attendant told me someone would essentially be then when they had time. Two hours later someone came. The dining hall and reception areas were really nice; but again; unless you're a large group don't expect to enjoy them during your stay at Affinia. Even if you could; the prices wouldn't be worth it.
1,1,Excellent service! Clean and spacious rooms with a great view of downtown Chicago. Location is excellent for exploring the main sights and the Golden Mile. Great concierge service. Pricey though... Don't valet if you don't need to.
0,1,My stay at the Ambassador East Hotel was a pleasant one. I loved being able to take a quick stroll to Michigan Ave for some shopping. I also loved the Pump Room. What a fun place to hang out and enjoy a Blood Mary. The front desk staff was wonderful with my check in since my reservation was lost. They found me a room immediately even though the city was book up. I thought the rooms were clean and well maintained. The shampoo was great and I decided to take it home with me. I am looking forward to another stay at the Ambassador EAst in the spring when I return to Chicago.
0,0,I selected The Talbott for my recent family vacation to Chicago. We chose the hotel for it's close proximity to Navy Pier and otherwise central location. In retrospect; the phrase "location; location; location" apparently does not apply to hotels. It's a good thing the location was so great; because just about everything that happened inside the hotel was bad. Upon our arrival; our room was not ready. The clerk could have been nicer about the whole situation; and told us simply that "we would have to wait" without offering any sort of help with our luggage or a timetable for when our room would be ready. When we finally arrived in the room; the sheets were not clean. A call to housekeeping proved difficult; as I do not speak Spanish. The second day of our trip; housekeeping never showed to clean the room despite the presence of our "please service" sign hung on the door. We stayed in for some room service after a long afternoon on Michigan Ave. When the food finally arrived a full hour after placing our order; it was cold and not very good. Despite these poor impressions; the management was unwilling to compromise on price at checkout. My call to corporate headquarters was answered by a call center in Mumbai. They will not receive my business again.
1,1,Stayed here October 31 through November 5 for a cconference. This is beautiful hotel and the location is perfect. The Art Institute and Millenium Park is a short 2 block walk from the hotel. My room was small; but beautiful. The bed was comfy and there were plenty of pillows. Alas; no coffee maker in the room...The staff was helpful and friendly. I'd stay here again!
0,1,conrad - The conrad is a terrific hotel! When I booked my room; I specifically asked them for a lower floor because I have fear for the heights; and they were really considerate in giving me a lower floor room with an excellent view. The room was larger than I expected and was very clean; and I could not be happier with what they gave me. Would come again.
1,1,I loved this hotel - fabulous old building but with first class modern amenities. Great location; as it's so close to both lakeshore and city. Chicago is such a walkable city; so this was a superb base. The staff were just lovely - so very friendly and efficient. The room was wonderful - very; very comfortable and exceptionally clean. Great chair. Great coffee. Lovely bathroom with a huge; absolutely fantastic shower. It was also extremely quiet. That; and the best bed ever; meant I slept so well and since I was there for a week; that was very important to me. Yummy martinis at the Martini Bar. I will most definitley be back!
1,0,My fiance and I traveled to Chicago for the first time this December and we were not happy with this hotel. The friendliest people on the staff were the bell boys. They greeted us with a smile and gave us lots of great advice throughout our stay. The rest of the staff however was terrible. When we first checked in; I was instantly discouraged. The front desk person was not in a good mood and I couldn't wait to leave the lobby. Having not traveled here before we were looking for exciting places to eat and to go sightseeing. We asked multiple staff members at the front desk of places to go and see and never got any good recommendations. We felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff. At one point; the front desk person was on the phone while we were waiting to talk to her; as she was on the phone a family of four came up behind us waiting to talk to her as well. Even though she saw us standing there; after she finished with the phone call she ignored us and helped the family first. Yes; we are in our mid 20's; but we are still paying guests and there is no reason to be treated like we are invisible. For how much money we paid for each night; I would have rather stayed somewhere else. We decided to go with this hotel because of the location and the great reviews; but we did not experience any of this during our stay. The rooms were alright; but nothing special. I would not stay in this hotel again.
0,1,Extravagant; Exuberant Experience! Our stay at Hotel Allegro was very enjoyable. The intoxicating views made the get-away much more relaxing; as well as the exceptional room service. The rooms were very decorative and well above par. I very much enjoyed the complimentary tea. I Would highly recommend Hotel Allegro as a must stay vacation get-away.
1,0,First room's heating system sounded like we had a generator in our room. Second room had stool in the toilet and a smear on the linens (which we didn't notice until morning-eeewwhh!). The computer; scale and ink pen didn't work. The maintainance man took 30 mins to come unplug the toilet and dripped to toilet water through bathroom and on carpet. This room was quiet and the bed/pillows comfortable. The bath was large and water warm.
0,1,"Classy";"Decent" and "Serene". these words clearly define the totality of my stay at the talbott hotel in the heart of chicago. the hustle and bustle of the city did little to affect the conducive atmosphere for relaxation provided by this posh hotel. the lounge was so welcoming and flashes of smiles from every angle.the staff from the bell-boy to the managers were polite; helpful and responsive to my needs. the room service was classy and to cap it all the beds were just as comfortable as back home; making the talbott a home away from home. my wife and i enjoyed the t-rex experience and learnt a lot about the city of chicago and what it has got to offer. believe me we will return with the kids because the talbott is family oriented and friendly to kids. it felt very safe. anytime we are in chicago the talbott is gonna be our home away from home!
0,0,I expected a bit more from the Hyatt Regency Chicago I stayed at recently. I was appalled of the conditions of the room we stayed in. The linens were not clean; the toilet paper roll was nearly empty with no spare left; and there was a lock on the door that didn't function. The turndown service left me no chocolate on my pillow and I think they took a few more pieces of the already nearly empty toilet paper; again with out leaving a spare. I would not stay there again. Traveler beware!!
1,1,We had a king deluxe room for 2 nights. We reserved the room through the hotel website with AAA discount. We paid $180/nt. We enjoy boutique hotels; as they have so much more personality and personal service. This hotel was no exception. Every employee we encountered was pleasant and helpful. The room was clean; well decorated; spacious and quiet. We were offered at check-in a room with a view; but warned it was across from the elevator; so we decided to take the quiet; large room with no view. The location of the hotel was perfect for us; we saw Wicked while in Chicago and had no problem walking to the theater. We also walked the Magnificient Mile and found the location perfect (we like to walk). We had drinks at the hotel restaurant both nights which was a pleasurable experience. We ate room service for breakfast each morning; and the food was good and the portions were quite large. We would definitely stay here again.
0,0,Hyatt Regency Hotel: Good ole Downtown; Chicago. Hypo-allergenic rooms are usually intended for the well-being of even the worst cases of allergen sufferers. Well; when we got to our room; one of the first things my wife did was sneeze four times. Upon setting up the channel scanning which; the reception came in fuzzy all around; there was an interattive ethernet feature that after; lost in confusion of how to work it; provided us with our first fee! The pool was in bad shape. The maids seemed to come and go with no intercommunicative qualities.. just knock knock knock. We let em' right in as they started vacuuming. One of the fluorescent bulbs on the ceiling was dimmer than the others and the Gideon's Bible had crib notes. What a room! Not to mention what the hotel was like! Oh geez.
0,1,The Palmer House Hlton Hotel has to be the nicest hotel I have stayed at in Chicago. I went to Chicago on a business trip for a meeting. When I arrived once I walked in; the lobby was beautiful; I couldn't hardly wait to see my room. The rooms were just as nice; the bathroom was immaculate! We had a meeting in the Clark Meeting Room; even that was nice! I wanted to take a tour of the hotel itself! I was there for about 3 days and because of how convenient the hotel was to a lot of major attractions like; Grant Park; Lake Michigan; Mag Mile which is a shopping heaven; and the Navy Pier; it never really like the normal stressed out meetings. I love Chicago and I now have a new favorite hotel to stay at while I'm in town.
1,0,I stayed at the Sheraton as it was where a conference I was attending was being held. On the plus side; the hotel is reasonably well located; within a few minutes walk of Michigan Avenue. My room had a superb view out over the river. However; for the price I must say that the room look decidedly shabby and worn and is in need of refurbishment. The decor was dated; and my bathroom unit was cracked and the shower rail rusty. The wifi is ridiculously expensive; and frustratingly as a conference delegate I was unable to use the service downstairs in the venue despite having paid for 24 hours access. There was no wifi in the conference rooms; although it was free in the lobby area should you wish to sit there and do your emails. I know Chicago is expensive; but for that price I feel the experience should have been better.
1,0,Will not stay here again. We were here pre-construction so didn't have the noise problems that others are now experiencing. But room and service quality were so poor that we will not return. Our suite was large enough; but it was dirty; dated and worn. The bed linens were stained and the bathroom did not appear to have been cleaned properly. Public hall areas had room service trays sitting for two days; disgusting. We (politely) requested housekeeping to touch up our room and pick up trays and they never showed. We had paid for the King Tut Package; which was supposed to include tickets to the exhibit. They had no record of this and didn't honor it. Of course; the exhibit was sold out; so our main reason for visiting Chicago was ruined as we weren't able to see this part of the Field museum. My (also polite) letter to Hilton and the manager was never acknowledged. Very very disappointed in this property and am now avoiding Hilton in general when possible.
1,1,I already wrote a review about all the free stuff you get but now I'm going to write about the location! I like to walk. This place was close to EVERYTHING!!!! The 'Taste of Chicago' was on during the 4th of July. Let me tell you; this was the best 'taste' of a city that I have ever been to. It was massive and took 10 mins to walk there. I took the train in from the airport (it was around $2.00 but it was a solid 45 mins but for $2.00; how can you complain?)and it was approx a 10 walk to the hotel. We pretty much walked everywhere. We walked the entire magnificent mile strip. We went to the Blue Navy or whatever the docks are called. My favourite bar was 'Pops for Champagne.' Wow. I love champagne. And then of course there was the John Hancock Centre. And lots of shopping!
0,1,Hard Rock Hotel Chicago - Location; location; location. Shopping; restaurants; and Chicago attractions didn't require driving to get to. The room was well maintained and had nice furniture. I really liked my comfy king sized bed and cushy pillows. Friendly staff and nice amenities were also plus. I would stay at this hotel again.
0,0,After arriving at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel I was greeted with rudeness and snubery. My room reservations had been double booked; and instead of the suite I expected; I was given a much smaller guest room. Instead of having a concierge I had cockroaches. The dining left me wishing for fast food. The bar left a bad taste in my mouth with the cheap liquor and hot beer.
0,0,I was not pleased with my recent stay at the Palmer House Hilton. My room was not ready upon my arrival and the room I was given was not what I had requested. I had requested a room with 2 queen size beds on a lower floor and was not given that. The air conditioning in my room was not functioning properly and it could not be turned off. The room had an overpowering fragrance smell which made my sinuses act up. I wondered what had happened in the room before I got it to make the housekeeping staff use so much air freshener. There was no doorman available or a cart so I had to lug my 3 suitcases by myself by dragging 2 of them about 20 feet and then going to get the other one so as not to lose sight of them at any point since they contained valuable irreplaceable items. Luckily another guest saw my predicament and offered assistance. My room had evidence of the previous occupants that had been left behind and overlooked by the housekeeping staff. They promised to send someone up to take care of the debris and after 3 calls to the front desk I finally gave up. I had looked forward to my stay there but have to conclude that it simply did not live up to the advertising and was a poor value for the money that I spent to stay there.
0,0,If you are looking for a high end hotel on the Magnificent Mile; the Affinia Chicago is NOT your best option. First of all; the "central" location is not so convenient - there is quite a hike to the Navy Pier (which this hotel claims to be the "official" hotel of) and to the shops on the Mile. Secondly; the hotel is small - only 215 rooms; most of which are miniscule by comparison to the other hotels in the area. Thirdly; they have one restaurant and one lounge; both of which offer the same menu which seems a bit bizarre for a high end hotel. Finally the Affinia has one of the most rude staffs ever witnessed in a luxury hotel. One does expect some courtesy at the outrageous prices but be ready for the attitude and snobbery that will greet you at the Affinia!
0,0,Last week; I booked a 'Deluxe Suite' at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a weekend stay in Chicago. I took the 'Retreat and Relax' package deal. The wait to check in was intolerably long; because they were letting some people check in with a dog. I'm allergic to dogs; and I'm sure its fur and dander got spread all over the room they were in. They insisted on escorting me to to my room; every time I came in; like I was going to break into another guest's room or something. I swear; anytime I was out of my room they were watching me like hawks; asking me if I needed anything. You know that the only time anyone does that is when they think you're up to something. I went to the pool; but it was full of screaming children. When I went to bed; I could hear the television in the next room through my wall. And what's worse; they wouldn't even let me smoke in the privacy of my room to relieve the stress. They threatened to throw me out on the street; after I gave them hundreds of my hard earned dollars! I had to go outside-- probably where the dog went to piddle-- to do it. Also; their on-site restaurant is too expensive; given that you're already paying an arm and a leg for the room. The food should be free! I wouldn't stay here again; it was a waste of my money.
1,0,I usually stay at the Hotel Monaco but stayed at the Allegro because most the Monaco was booked. While the Allegro is similar to the Monaco in it's decor (less traditional and more funky interior) it is not nearly as nice. The linens are not as high quality as the Monaco and the rooms are not decorated as nice. The rooms are also smaller. The main reason I would not recommend the hotel though; is the bathroom. It has an old tiled floor; with an old sink; and old toilet. It reminds me of something you would find in a men's locker room. Although the Allegro has installed a nice mirror; it does not make up for the limited counter space and dingy apperance. Also; the layout of the bathroom is terrible. The toilet is so close to the wall that the toilet paper sits in your lap as you sit on the toilet. Also; the room is not very clean as well. The floor in my room was dirty and I found crumbs in the drawers. I would recommend staying at the Monaco; Hard Rock; or Soffitel for a hotel that is a little less traditional but still nice.
1,0,I travel to chicago quite often; and have stayed at a bunch of hotels. I stayed at Conrad a couple of times. My impression was not too good. Both times the receptionist was quite cold and I didn't feel welcome at all. The room was noisy. Thin walls; and you could hear exactly what the next room is talking about. One time the tv was broken too; and a guy came in and took like an hour to fix it... Anyway; given that this is a 4.5 star hotel; it really didnt live up to my expectations. After the 1st time at this hotel; I thought I might give it a second try. After the 2nd time; I decided I am really not coming back; especially given that there are so many other hotels close by. The other attendees of our conferences were also complaining about the hotel. So I guess I am not alone in this...
0,1,Omni Chicago Hotel – Stayed here for a 2 nights while attending a business-related conference. Room and bathroom were clean / spacious and contained all the usual amenities; though my room surprisingly lacked a coffee machine. Free wifi was provided: a necessity for any business traveller planning to catch up on some work. The continental breakfast had a wide selection of options; from fresh fruit and cereal to hot scrambled eggs and bacon -- one of the best free breakfast options I have seen in a hotel. Would definitely stay here again.
1,0,If I didn't have to stay here; I wouldn't. Without exception; I swear I am not lying; every day of my stay brings a new problem. Over the past 3 months; I have stayed here 6 times for 3 nights at a time; problems every time. From the wrong food with room service; to room keys that dont work; unrefreshed bath towels; forgotten and dirty in-room coffee service; unclean ice bucket overnight; forgotten room cleaning; inability to connect to the Internet....I'm too tired to keep writing all the problems. For the price of this chi-chi downtown hotel; I expect more. Finally; their team is certainly not trained in customer service. The front desk teams have attitudes; and Aria's hostesses think they are something else. I'm stuck using this hotel since it is adjoined to Aon; but I would never go back if I had a choice. The only good thing is the food at Aria - outstanding.
0,0,Palmer House a Hilton Hotel - Here's a PSA: if you enjoy peace and quiet; do NOT stay at the Chicago Hilton. Going in; I didn't know the place allowed pets; and I got stuck next to a family that had brought their dog. Forget street noise - I couldn't hear the cars over all the barking. I complained; but management said all their basic rooms were full so I'd have to pay for an upgrade to a suite if I wanted to move.  The bed was comfortable enough; but there were some stains on the comforter when I got there. At least management didn't try to charge me to fix THAT issue. The pillows were a bit over-plump as well. As for location; there are some tourist spots nearby; but some of the places I wanted to see were a decent distance away. The zoo and the Museum of Science are too far to walk to; so if you want to check those places out; you'll have to bring your car and pay the hotel's sky-high parking prices; pay for a taxi; or figure out Chicago's public transportation system. Bit of a hassle; really. On the plus side; the hotel definitely impressed in the looks department: my room was nicely decorated and the hotel's ballrooms were gorgeous. When it comes down to it; though; in the future; I'd just rather spend my money on a comfortable room in a convenient location; rather than a pretty; "landmark" tourist trap.
0,1,This hotel was wonderful. My room was clean and the staff was courteous. The food provided by the restaurant was exceptional. This was on of the best hotel stays; ive experienced. I highly suggest this hotel to others.
0,0,Although the Architecture of the hotel is quaint; that is about the only positive of this terible hotel. The guest services were unhelpful at best; and the inbuilding resturaunts were unsanitary and untasteful. And as for the rooms; small; cramped; and it seemed as if the sheets hadn't been cleaned in the last 5 years. My stay here was distasteful; and I never intend to return; except to ask for my money back.
1,0,My sister and I stayed on the 22nd floor; there was a refrigerator in the hallway for the first three nights; beat up and old dorm style. It was not until we told the concierge that we were going to post the picture we took of it on Tripadvisor did the thing get removed. Breakfast dishes left outside rooms will stay on the floor for a day or two routinely. All night there are chimes that make noise; that are supposed to be comformting or relaxing and rather they are just annoying. There is no wifi - no matter what they tell you; I paid for the wifi; and still we were unable to get on. Lastly; my sister and I split the bill; I had already paid for the first night in form of a deposit and they gave her the credit. Room cost with city taxes etc. was 313.69 a night. I know the Comfort Inn just a few blocks away is significantly cheaper! So while the View was wonderful; it is NOT worth the money.
0,1,Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago - I stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights several weeks ago.  Overall; it was a very comfortable experience for me.  The staff at the front desk were very courteous.  They were able to upgrade me from a standard room to one of their junior suites; which was a pleasant surprise.  Instead of just a single room; there was an elegant sitting area sectioned off by a half-wall to the right of the bed; which helped the area feel spacious.  To the left of the bed was an AMAZING bathroom; I loved the rainshower system!  Very relaxing.  Housekeeping did an outstanding job keeping my room clean; and room service was very prompt.  My only dislike about the place is that they charge for wireless internet access; but that is standard for high-end hotels like the Millennium Knickerbocker.
1,1,The service from check-in to checkout was excellent - timely and efficient. The room was more then I has expected. It was spacious and laid out very well. I particularly enjoyed the living room area as well as the double closets and separate bath and shower. The bed abd pillows were extremely comfortable. I believe it's the first time I stayed in a hotel that provided a toothbrush and toothpaste in the room. The location was perfect for us as we were able to walk to everywhere we needed to go. I particularly enjoyed the excellent food at theChina Grill which is attached to the Hard Rock hotel. The service was very good and the staff very friendly.
1,1,I stayed at ICH Chicago for business in November of 2006 and loved it. As a Royal Ambassador member; they upgraded me to a beautiful junior suite with a separate living and working area and 2 bathrooms! My upgrade was in place upon arrival and a beautiful fruit basket was waiting for me on the coffee table. They even had a nice young lady escort me to my room. The suite was beautifully furnished and had an Art Deco feel to it. The only thing I regretted was that I only stayed one night. I will definitely stay here on my next visit.
0,0,After a one night stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I must say that while I loved Chicago I will never go back to this hotel. The problems started in the parking lot; yup before I even got in. There was very little parking available and the area was filled with garbage; broken glass and kids hanging out looking for trouble. Upon first entrance the hotel seemed nice but all that changed as we got into the elevator to go up to the room. The elevator made all kinds of noise and the door slammed shut on my arm as I was trying to get the bags out. The hall smelled of smoke and the carpets were warn and dirty looking. When in the room we found that one of the curtains would not pull closed; the heater whistled and when I called the front desk to ask for assistance and fresh pillows I was hung up on. This was only the beginning of our terrible stay. Guests where in the hall and banging on walls all night long. The maids started running vacuums before 8 am and seemed to feel that the best way to do it was by hitting the vacuum on the wall with each pass. We could not check out soon enough! We called around and found another hotel to stay in for the remainder of our trip.
1,0,This hotel was chosen by my husband's company as the family came along for the business trip. The location was excellent and we had a great view of the lake and aquarium from the 34th floor. My first impressions were that the room was very nice and everything appeared to be clean. The lobby was undergoing renovation at the entrance; but was otherwise ok. Lots of conferences were taking place so the wait for the elevators was long. Seemed like only 2 elevators were working out of the 6 that were there. I had read from another reviewer to join the Fairmont President's club and wi-fi in the room would be free. We signed up for the club; but were puzzled as to why they don't just offer everyone free wi-fi. Parking fees were exorbitant at $58/night; but thankfully the company was paying for this. We were able to walk to Millennium Park and Navy Pier from our hotel. The hotel is NOT kid-friendly in terms of restaurants or amenities. There is no swimming pool; but the concierge arranged for us to swim at the Swissotel next door (there is an underground tunnel that connects the Fairmont there). We loved the Swissotel's pool on the 42nd floor. Fantastic views from the pool! Although the beds were comfortable; my daughter and I were both victims of bed bugs during our stay. Unfortunately we didn't know until the next day after we returned home. Apparently bed bug bites can take up to 7 days to appear. My daughter and I both shared a bed and were bitten on our sides from our necks to our hips. The bites made you want to claw your skin off! My husband and son who shared the other bed were not bitten at all. Beware of room 3405 -- bed nearest the bathroom!!! I will not be fooled by a clean room again and will be checking under mattresses from now on....
0,0,Hard Rock Hotel - I spent two nights at the Hard Rock Hotel during the week of Thanksgiving; and to be honest; it did not meet my expectations. The pictures online made the rooms look huge; but when I arrived; my room was no bigger than your average 4-star hotel room. The bathroom was clean; but again average; there was no luxury shower; the toilet was cramped up against the end of the sink vanity; and the sink itself was fairly shallow. The hotel is in a nice location; but even on a Thursday night the streets below will boast noise loud enough to keep you awake. Anyway; it's not a bad hotel; but it's not as exciting as you would guess.
0,1,Hyatt Regency Chicago - When I first arrived at the Hyatt Regency I was concerned because of the size of my room; but I was happily surprised.  There was more than enough space.  The beds were comfortable; and the location in the center of Chicago is amazing.  For only $150 a night; this was a real steal.
0,0,The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park has to be one of the most overpriced hotels I have stayed at in a while. At almost $500 a night; one would expect. Traveling with my wife; I expected to pay the cost of the room; already being outrageous; but then I was hit with another $20 charge for her to stay. Even with a King bed; they only figure in one person to their cost. The beds were average and although there was much to do; everything cost an arm or a leg. It was unbelievable how much they charge for everything and to see people paying it like it was normal blew me away. All in all for the amount of money that I was paying on a per night basis; if I was in Chicago for any longer than that one night; I definitely would have stayed somewhere else. I guess you live and you learn; its just a shame that I had to learn with such a high bill for very average accommodations.
0,1,After recent week stay at the Affinia Hotels; I can definitely say i will be coming back. They offer so many in room amenities and services; Just a very comfortable and relaxed place to be. My most enjoyable experience at the Affinia Hotel was the amazing customization they offered; I would recommend Affinia hotels to anyone looking for a nice place to stay .
1,1,My husband; teenage son and myself stayed at this hotel last August. We were transferred there by tour operator who had sent us to a terrible hotel on the other side of Chicago. When I complained I asked for us to be transferred to the Sheraton which they arranged for us. I have stayed at many hotels in my life and this has been the best. The room (although I know it was not the largest) was beautiful and very clean with every amenity you needed. It also had superb views of the river and the lake. The entrance hall to the Sheraton is so imressive as is the leisure centre. In fact all areas are fantastic. The best thing about the hotel though was the staff! From the bellboy; to the receptionists; the dining staff to the concierge - each one was courteous and so very helpful. One of the conciergies spent fifteen minutes on the phone trying to locate a specific pair of trainers for my son! Above and beyond the call I would say! I cannot reccomend this hotel highly enough. The breakfast buffet cost about 10 dollars each but you could eat as much as you like and take as long as you like which we did!! It lasted us all day. If you have the choice of where to stay I think you will enjoy the Sheraton! We did!!
0,0,When I first made reservations at The Palmer House Hilton; I was excited because of all the gorgeous pictures displayed on their website. Little did I know it was going to be a total disaster. First off; my husband and I couldn't find the place. It was our first time in Chicago after all. And when I would call for directions; they just kept putting me on hold. When my husband and I finally arrived; the bus boy was extremely rude. After man-handling our luggage; he held his hands out impatiently expecting a tip. Talk about arrogant. The front desk clerk was a little too pushy. My husband and I were only staying one night just to attend my sister's wedding; but they kept trying to up-sell a suite when all we needed was a regular guest room. The room itself was okay; decorated so ornately that they are forced to jack up the price and take all that you're worth. They even had the nerve to try and say that we purchased some items from the "snack bar" and ordered a movie that I've never even heard of! Completely unprofessional. I will never; I repeat; NEVER stay at this hotel ever again.
1,0,For a supposed 4-star hotel; I was not very impressed at akk. The lobby was nice and modern-looking; but there were no bellhops outside to help with bags or open the doors (we didn't arrive that late at night). Additionally; when we walked into the hotel late one night; there was trash and flowers strewn on the lobby floor and; it seemed that there were always water bottles and glasses near the seating area as you walked in. Where was the staff to clean up? That's not a very welcoming sight. The rooms were nice and clean and provided a great view; but the actual location was farther than I would have preferred from Michigan Avenue; andi it was also a little too far south. Area recommendations Rush Street was a lot of fun at night!
1,0,First; several day s prior to my stay; I called and spoke at length with the concierge and made a breakfast order for room-service Saturday and Sunday. Saturday they didn't bring breakfast - and when I called room-service they stated they never got the advance order from the concierge. When they finally did bring it - they brought the wrong thing.. and then brought the wrong order again on Sunday. I was further inconvenienced by in-room dining staff when we ordered room service Saturday night. The food was limp and uninspired. Further; I ordered soup - which arrived without a spoon. When I called in-room dining to request a spoon; I was told one would be forthcoming. 15 minutes later; a waiter arrived with a menu. When I explained I already had food and I didn't need a menu - I needed a spoon; he had the audacity to argue with me. I respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so. Another 15 minutes (and one bowl of cold soup) later I decided to call in-room dining back to request (again) they send someone with a spoon. They too argued with me and expressed that they'd already sent someone with a spoon. I explained that they had not - that I had received a menu I didn't request; but that no spoon was forthcoming. Another 15 minutes later; a spoon finally arrived. Thanks - for charging me $100+ so that I could argue over cold; flavorless food. In addition to the gross customer service; surly attitude; and sorry food; I found the room woefully lacking. It reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on Saturday night I woke up from the smell. Further; I had specifically requested when I booked the reservation that you keep me away from the elevators... I was right next to the elevators and had the displeasure of listening to them ding all night long as other guests came and went.
0,1,Homewood Suites - Wonderful stay at the Homewood Suites Hilton! Great location; within walking distance to the Magnificent Mile. Clean room and attentive staff. Take time to visit the pool as it has a great view of the cityscape. Would definitely stay here again next time I am in Chicago.
0,0,I had a business trip coming up in Chicago and I wanted to stay someplace really nice; cause I had never been there; so made reservations with the James two weeks in advance just to be on the safe side and when I arrived they had no record of it. No big deal; right? They said they would take care of it and get me a room right away... two hours later I'm still sitting in the lobby! Finally I get to my room to try and relax. Everything was nice until I decided to take a shower. I went into the bathroom... no towels; wash cloths; nothing. I called down to the front desk and asked for some; about an hour later someone came up with one. Maybe they were just really busy? Finally I get in the shower and the handle is BROKEN!!! I went down to the front desk and asked for a new room and they started implying that I broke it!!! They said everything was fine with the room earlier that day and that I must have done something to it!!! Leaving that hotel was the easiest decision I made on my whole trip. Two thumbs down!
0,0,I had high hopes for the Ambassador East Hotel; I really did. It seemed like a nice enough place with reasonably close beach access. I arrived to the hotel on a Tuesday afternoon. I was immediately surprised by the state of disrepair that the building was in. I could actually see two members of hotel maintenance in the parking lot sitting in their truck; doing nothing. As I walked in; nobody greeted me; and nobody offered to take my bags. The hotel furniture looked quaint and outdated; with a fine covering of dust. I went to the counter to check in and the disinterested girl working barely glanced at my papers and slid me my keys; all while avoiding eye contact and typing on the computer. I got to my room; and despite specifically asking for nonsmoking; there was a distinct smell of cigarettes inside and in the hallway. Having paid extra for an upgraded room; I was extremely disappointed by the condition inside. The drinking glasses were filthy; the towels smelled of mold; and there was actually trash that was left in the bathroom trash can. The television was a basic CRT that looked to be about fifteen years old; and there was no channel guide; though I suppose I didn't need one for the six channels that it had. I had heard good things about the food at the Ambassador East hotel; but alas; there was no respite here. The room service that I ordered took forty minutes to arrive; and my steak was cold and cooked beyond well done. Elsewhere in the hotel things were no better. Everywhere I went; from the pool to the bar; the staff was hasty; rude; and completely uninterested; and nowhere was particularly clean or well decorated. I really wanted to like the Ambassador East Hotel; but unfortunately the best part of my stay was checking out.
0,0,I recently stayed at this hotel not to long ago. Sure; it looks nice; but it's really just a smoke screen. I went to the clerk to check in and she was VERY rude to me. I was asking about nearby attractions and she abruptly cut me off to tell me that I need to go find a phone book and ask someone else. She also encoded my key wrong; so I had to have it redone. I finaly get to my room; only to discover it was a mess. The sheets were thrown on the floor; the curtains were wide open and to top it all off; the toliet hadn't been flushed. It was horrible. I called the front desk to have a maid come and fix it up; but I was told they were on break. Whatever thoguh; I cleaned up myself. The night progresses and I awaken to the sound of someone beating on my door. Some guy said that I was in HIS room. It baffled me; but we went straight down to the lobby and got it cleared up. They had given his the wrong room. I couldn't take one more day of all the bull. I checked out early the next morning and stayed at a different hotel for the remainder of my visit to Chicago. I would NOT recommend this hotel to ANYONE.
1,0,I only stayed at this hotel for one night; the location was great but the elevators drove me crazy. After the first long wait I started to time how long it took from the moment I pushed the button until the elevator arrived; never under 10 min. even late at night. I went up to the rooftop for and after dinner drink with my husband... 1 margarita was $14! I wans't drinking because I'm pregnant so I had a soda water for $4... if I would have known I would have had tap water. Overall... great rooms; OK staff ; horrible elevators; overpriced drinks.
1,0,After checking out of the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower the other day; I left the hotel; crossed the street and started to walk EB on Chestnut while looking for a cab. I was still within sight of a Sofitel doorman when I sighted a cab approximately one block away and attempted to hail same. After doing so; I immediately heard a Sofitel doorman yelling for me to stop and then heard the sound of his whistle. As the cab slowed to pick me up; the doorman continued to yell at me and blow his whistle as he started to run in my direction. When the cab stopped; I quickly entered cab and locked the door for fear of being physically attacked by the Sofitel doorman. After locking the door; the doorman attempted to open the door as he continued to accost me from outside of the cab. After claiming that he had hotel customers waiting for cabs; he suggested that I had no right to hail a cab in the vicinity of the hotel and then called me a "jerk" before allowing the cab driver to depart to my destination. Consequently; unless you enjoy being accosted by hotel doormen; please don't attempt to hail a cab anywhere near the hotel under any circumstances without first securing the permission of a doorman. Lastly; as for the rest of my stay; you will enjoy this hotel if you seek a highly pretentious staff who prefer to speak to guests in French instead of English. While I have nothing against the French or French language; I much prefer communicating in English when visiting one of the best cities in the best country in the world. Viva la USA!
1,1,Great hotel in a wonderful location. I stayed in this hotel last weekend for one night before coming home and I loved it. I couldn't recommend it highly enough. Evidently popular and busy; the staff were still helpful. The rooms were lovely and spacious and clean. Bathrooms were clean; bright and spacious also. I'd definitely recommend this hotel too; it's close to the magnificant mile.
1,1,My wife and I had to stay downtown for event that we were attending at the Drake Hotel. I have stayed at the Drake before and while it is nice; it is bit stuffy and a little outdated for the price. We opted to walk across the street and stay at the Millenium instead. I know this property has under gone many renovations in past year and I have to say they have done a great job. This place used to be the hotel you would crash in when you came to Chicago on a college roadtrip (I did). But that is not the case any more. This property is directly across from the Drake Hotel and for 1/2 the price you get their great location with a newer (albeit smaller) room and every ammenity you would expect from a 4* hotel. The rooms are tastefully decorated (Asian influence w/flat screen tv) and the bed is very comfortable. The bath is small (no tub); but very clean and the shower is great. You are not going to be spending a bunch of time in your room when visting Chicago; so the room's size is not a big deal. (It works well with a couple; but a family of four may be a bit cramped.) The service was attentive and friendly and the location can't be beat. I would definitely stay here again; but the next time I would leave the car at home ($49/night parking is a bit steep).
0,1,My stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago was an amazing experience! The staff were helpful and considerate; always there to tend to my needs. My suite was extremely clean; and had all the amenities that I could ask for. I almost didn't want to leave my room; because it was so nice. But in the end I did; because the hotel is situated in such a great area; that I had to go out and see some of the sites. This hotel has wonderful rooms and service; and is in a really great area. I suggest that everyone come here if they are staying in Chicago.
0,1,Fantastic stay! The hotel was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean. I chose this place because a friend recommended it plus it was VERY close to my business conference. Here you get the resources and exemplary four star luxury treatment with the downtown Chicago charm. Be sure to try the ribs at South Water Kitchen next door. They are the best I've ever had. EVER! If youre in the mood to unwind; you can sample the evening wine tastings downstairs or take a walk and explore the nightlife all around. I had a great time here. From now on; I won't stay anyplace else.
1,0,The bathroom toilet leaked water all over the bathroom every time it was flushed; so we called maintenance to have it fixed. We returned to our room only to discover the maintenance personnel had left a nasty mess in the bathroom and the toilet seat was covered in grease. There were dirty clothes all over the bathroom and they even used our guestroom towels to clean their hands and tools. We love Chicago but we are never staying at this hotel again.
0,0,The pictures on this website sure are deceiving! In real life the Palmer House Hilton is not nearly as pretty as its made out to be! The cleaning staff was still there when we arrived at our room and they made us wait outside while they were still cleaning! Now; granted it was only 15 minutes and sometimes guests can be messy but I thought that was the only weird thing I would have to put up with on that trip. It wasn't! They charged us for a mini-bar fee when we don't even drink; no one told us that we would have to pay for liquor anyway! They also did not get our wake-up calls to us on time; so we missed our tour bus and almost a whole day of our trip. We had to spend $50 extra bucks on cab fees just so we could see the city in the way we'd planned! And then it wasn't as good because the tour guide wasn't there and we got lost! My husband lost the key to our room at one point on this trip and the desk gave him a hard time about getting a new one. It was terrible! I certainly won't be staying here again!
0,1,I stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel for a fun weekend in Chicago. The standard room had a nice king size bed that was nice and comfortable. I love a hotel with all white sheets because then I know it's clean. I really liked the simple and modern decor; especially the huge upholstered headboard. Nice fixtures in the bathroom and granite counter. The bathroom was so much nicer than my own bathroom at home. The staff was friendly. Can't really judge the service because I didn't have any problems or complaints. So I didn't have a reason to interact with the staff much. Overall; it was a very nice hotel in a great location. Will definitely stay here again on my next visit.
1,1,My husband attended a conference in Chicago for the weekend of June 22nd and I decided to tag along for the shopping! We flew into O'Hare and took a cab to the hotel; cost about $30. Everybody from the doorman to reception desk to concierge were extremely friendly and helpful. We had a room on the 9th floor which overlooked the construction; but we were hardly in the room so it didn't bother us. We were also never awakened due to construction noise and my husband is a very light sleeper. The room was clean and spacious enough for us. The bed is very comfy. We ate in the restaurant downstairs several times for breakfast and lunch and all meals were great. The location of this hotel is perfect. You are about 1&1/2 blocks from Michigan Ave and the Hancock tower. Can't beat that! There is also an adorable pet store called Tails In The City across from the hotel! I brought our dog back a couple of toys! They are very nice as well. All in all; no complaints. The hotel is clean and beyond what we were expecting. The staff is always friendly and the location is superb. It's a safe neighborhood-I walked around by myself and felt fine. We would definitely return.
1,0,My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum. I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool; one white phone and one emergency red phone; to call the desk. Both were out of service!!!! I am glad there wasn't an emergency. As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean.... never heard back. One more thing; in our room the furniture was mostly child friendly except for a large metal and glass outdated coffee table. Within 30 minutes my 5 year old fell and hit her mouth and began bleeding. They need to update this piece of furniture.
0,1,I stayed here with my family when we were in Chicago on a family vacation. All I can say is WOW! A fantastic experience all around. First off; the hotel is magnificent; the lobby/entreway is jaw dropping to say the least. Everyone we dealt with from the desk clerks; to the cleaning staff; to the doormen were all exceptionally cordial and friendly. The rooms themselves are fantastic; perfect for a business person there for a stay or for a family there for recreation. The new Serenity beds that the Hilton offered were to die for! One of the most restful nights sleep i have had in years! The kids loved the Ipod docks in the rooms and my wife and I loved th fact the kids could keep their bedroom ice cold like they like it and we could keep it warmer in ours. As usual; it had wifi; which was ultra cheap and very very fast. Over all i highly recommend The Palmer House Hilton!
0,1,The Amalfi Hotel in Chicago is a wonderful hotel. I had the opportunity to stay there on business and wished I could have stayed for longer. The staff is so nice and helpful. They really treat you like a VIP and are there to help with any questions you might have. The rooms are so beautifully decorated that you wish you could hire their designer to do your home. In my room I had access to my own personal dvd and cd collection. Did I say IN the room? I didn't even have to leave or order something on the television. It was nice to shower with their AVEDA products and get into my microfiber robe and slippers that they supplied me. While staying in for the night I was also able to use my laptop in my room since they have wifi throughout the hotel.The bed was very comfortable and everything was so clean! In the morning I was treated to a great complimentary breakfast and ordered a massage. Yes...ordered. They came to my room and I didn't even have to leave. Very comfy! This hotel was by far the best that I have stayed in and I travel a lot for business so I would know.You always have high expectations when you're staying at hotels and I'm pleased to say that my expectations were far exceeded. I'm recommending this hotel to everyone I know that will be staying in the Chicago area. I will definitely be back and make reservations for a longer stay this time because I just didn't want to leave! I would rate this hotel 5 out of 5 stars.
1,0,Don't stay here if you take peace in knowing you have a reservation. About 3 months ago; we booked a room here for our wedding night (which is in less than 2 weeks). My fiance called last week to confirm the room and everything was great until today when they called to bump us to another hotel - no upgrades; no discounts. Apparently it is my problem that their manager can't manage the convention schedule. I don't even want to stay at another Kimpton Hotel because I don't find their reservation system reliable. Unfortunately; due to the conference; there isn't any other place to stay.
0,0,Upon entering my hotel room at The Palmer House Hilton I immediately turned my nose up at a foul odor coming from the bathroom. After placing my bags on a poorly made bed I walked into the bathroom to find the last visitor had failed to flush the toilet. I immediately called room service and asked for a new room. They apologetically told me there were no other rooms available but would send someone right up to handle the mess. After oh around a half hour of waiting a very angry maid knocked at my door. She seemed very irritated to have to deal with the mess and looked at me as if I should have been the one dealing with it. After the room was cleaned up she turned to me as if asking for a tip. I hesitated and she angrily stormed out of the room. I thought things would run smoother and tried to relax with an ipod. Yes you can use your ipod in the room however what they fail to mention is the constant white noise because the signals are so poor. And nothing could compare to the remote control heating and air. When I was able to get the buttons on the remote to work the temperature seemed to change on its own. If I wanted hot air it would slowly get colder and vise versa. After giving up on a nice television program I decided to retire to bed. Egyptian sheets? Right! All I can say is I found myself early to check out and in a new hotel within the next hour. If you value your back do not rent a room from this hotel.
0,0,Swissotel Chicago: Don't let the shiny bright lights of the windy city fool you. This hotel does not provide the luxurious experience or stay as you might expect. Firstly; the provided appliances and room gadgets are of relatively low quality. For example; the window curtain for a small bedroom window nearly broke off it's support after trying to open them for a city view. The bedroom bed (King-sized) makes rattling noises on every turn of the body you make. Of coarse; this isn't too bad once you fall asleep; until then; it sucks! In regards to room services; the hotel workers are not all that friendly. They talk to you in a stubborn way; as if they just want to get it done and over with; just to get their pay-check. Yes they do all basic room service orders; but it is not all too friendly. Overall; this hotel has it's much noticeable flaws on top of the positives this hotel has (which is a bare minimum). With that being said; I would not recommend this hotel for anyone around the downtown Chicago area in need for at least average hotel services. However; if sub-par service and quality is okay for you; then this hotel could be suitable; however; considering it's prices; you are better off looking elsewhere for hotel rooms.
