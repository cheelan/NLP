{0} whether the story is entirely true or in some parts made up as the director stated it is is unimportant the film covers the intriguing subject matter of how four single new yorkers exist for a period of nine months featuring the real lives of two female and two male actors who play themselves concerned with getting older and still being single <>
their single scene is provocatively portrayed as being sad and luridly comical <>
it is a film that highlights the problems that can be found in urban areas across america as we bear witness to the plight of these singles trying to search for a mate through the internet and the personals faced with agonizing loneliness and unresolved psychological problems <>
that these four are not particularly people that i can readily sympathize with does not alter the fact that this is a very human story being told one that has many implications on our culture relating how alienated a people so many of us have become in this modern world <>
{1} the result is an interesting and stylized docudrama a rear window for singles <>
the film imitates those famous apartment windows jimmy stewart looked into for that s look at new york city <>
this time it is not a crime that we see but is a voyeurists delight and there is something that seems to excite us when we sneak a look at what someone does in the privacy of their own home as if we are seeing something about them that we shouldnt see <>
but it is the four singles who remain the focus of the film which is really not a documentary except in its style <>
{-1} brenda monte is italian she does not care for jewish men and will not even consider dating them because she does not find them attractive she is most proud of her big breasts has a yearold daughter from a previously failed marriage and she tells us she receives no child support for her <>
this could be a personal ad about her if it also included that she wants a guy not for sex or love she can have sex whenever she wants to but for monetary reasons <>
she wants to work out some deal with a guy where they come to some arrangement satisfactory to both of them but she must get money for it and it should be clear that she is not a prostitute <>
her vulgar story is interspliced with the three other stories but there is no connecting links to the others <>
{0} michael de stephano is the nicest one of the four except this little negative fixation he has about homosexuals <>
it probably stems from his fear that people will think that he is queer because he is not married <>
he is a yearold romantic who is troubled that women find his diminuitive height to be a nono for them <>
he wants a permanent relationship with marriage in mind <>
he is serious stable and straightforward and sounds a lot like what women want in guy but he says that is what they say they want but in reality they are really attracted to the jerks who lie to them and treat them badly going after them just for the sex <>
{0} aimee copp has the most serious problems of the four she is obese depressive has lost hope suffers from a poor image of herself and desperately wants to get married <>
she relates these feelings to her lifetime childhood friend laurie who happens to be skinny and is not faced with the tormenting dating problems her yearold friend is having <>
{0} mikey russo is a braggart who backs up his claims that he only goes out with beauties by showing snapshots of some of his previous dates <>
he is obnoxious but not as obnoxious as he makes himself out to be <>
though it is very hard to feel sympathy for him especially after he shows us how he will get out of a date with a mutt which in his lingo is an ugly dog by having someone at work beep him so he can make an excuse to leave <>
this yearold failed screenwriter and current security director prides himself on being a gentleman and makes no bones about the fact that he is a womanizer and admits that he is his own worst enemy <>
all he wants in life is to take an attractive lady to bed <>
{1} this film might be upsetting to some but it is a fresh look at an old problem and its aim is readily accomplished as it offers us an unorthodox study in human behavior under the guise of being a documentary <>

[17108/b+]
{2} a brilliant witty mock documentary of jean seberg that puts words in her mouth that she might have approved of but did not actually say these are mark rappaports words <>
proving once again that she is being exploited though in a benevolent way by a film that rails against her exploitation <>
she was exploited by the director who discovered this yearold in a nationwide star search for an unknown to play the juicy part in his saint joan that is the irrepressible otto preminger the charming party guest the publicity hound and the tyrannical director for women and her second husband romaine gary who poked fun at her political views and humiliated her in his films <>
there was also the brief affair with the future star clint eastwood which meant nothing to him and everything to her and the f b i under j edgar hoover spreading malicious rumors about her falsely saying she was pregnant with a black child trying everything possible to ruin her career and life <>
{0} mary beth hurt is a perfect jean seberg looking and sounding like her exhibiting the easy way she talked reflecting her smalltown midwestern iowa roots <>
this journal a journal that she never kept takes us through her innocent years up to her suicide in when she was and was resolved in the knowledge that she couldnt be the somebody that she wasnt <>
{1} rappaport interestingly explores the early film life of vanessa redgrave and jane fonda who started out the same time she did and were roughly the same age and were exploited as much as she was but who survived to find their own identity and stardom <>
the difference between their success and her failure he points out is that these stars had a distinguished family name to see them through <>
this film is as much about them as it is about her covering the film industry with the knowledge that it is called showbiz he says not showart <>
{0} her involvement with the black panthers shows that her motivation was to be of help to the downtrodden to get the kids a better education and food in their belly thinking that maybe violence was some kind of answer to the poverty and injustice she saw in the black community <>
by this time her life had taken a downward turn she was heavily into drinking and taking drugs her judgment was certainly questionable <>
{0} preminger the egotist he was answered the critics who panned her acting ability in saint joan by giving her another starring part in one of his films realizing that they did it with such glee partly because they wanted him to fall on his face <>
but he wouldnt admit he was wrong and immediately cast her in his next film bonjour tristesse <>
she played the younger woman in love with an older man <>
this is the film that the french critic and soon to be new wave cinema icon jeanlucgodard saw her in and took her to paris to play in the critically acclaimed breathless <>
she was to appear in many films afterward but her best role might have been in a film few people saw or cared about lilith <>
where she holds her own with such future stars and scene stealers as peter fonda and warren beatty <>
{2} this film challenges our credibility it offers a fascinating look at the world of make believe and the politics of the times telling us secrets that may or may not be true <>
it also enlightens us that sebergs stare into the camera was basically a nono for an actor to do at that time but is now acceptable making her a trend setter <>
in the voiceover he says that she felt the camera was stealing her soul <>
this is a clever film immensely satisfying and enjoyable and fortunately the director casts jean in a favorable light she seems to deserve that <>

[17109/a+]
{0} tarkovsky in his book sculpting in time mentions that he wanted to make a film about russian nostalgia about that state of mind peculiar to our nation which affects russians who are far from their native land <>
i wanted the film to be about the fatal attachment of russians to their national roots an attachment which they will carry with them for their entire lives regardless of where destiny may fling them <>
how could i have imagined as i was making this film that the stifling sense of longing that fills the screen was to become my lot for the rest of my life that from now until the end of my days i would bear the painful malady within myself <>
{2} for that reason seeing how the filmmaker himself was pleased with the film and considered it so important to himself and because of the power and perfection of craft the film exhibited it makes it that much easier for me to say that this film ranks as one of his best works an intriguing masterpiece that is equal to if not better than his other masterpieces solaris andrei rublyov the sacrifice and mirror <>
{0} this is the tale and it seems almost unreal and dreamlike at times of a russian poet oleg who is on assignment in italys tuscany area to write a book about an obscure th century russian composer sosnovsky who studied music in bologna <>
his landowner sent him there because he believed he was immensely talented <>
he was able to live in italy for awhile composing but he soon returned to russia voluntarily to face enslavement as a serf evidently feeling that he would rather be a slave in the country he loved than a free man in a country he did not understand <>
something must have gone wrong because soon after his return he hung himself <>
how to understand that is puzzling to oleg who is deeply plagued himself with family problems and deeply ensconced in a brooding type of meditation definetly not buddhistlike that leaves him in a state of disorientation as he tries to discover who he is <>
{1} the film opens in a deep fog as he and his rubenesque italian translator giordano drive in the sloping mountaneous terrain to visit one of the shrines that mostly women tourists visit when they pray here to the virgin mary <>
this opening scene is shot in black and white until the translator enters the church and then it is shot in a magnificent sepia and pastel coloring <>
the visual images of all the scarved peasant ladies with lit candles and starlings coming out of the virgins body are indeed startling <>
tarkovsky will use the black and white shots again in the film when he is using flashbacks to show that he is dreaming or reflecting back on the events in his life <>
{0} the first impression one gets is that he is having an affair with his translator but that is not the case he is so obsessed with his thoughts that he has difficulty communicating with her which is frustrating for her as she expects something to happen between them and when nothing happens blames it on her poor luck of always choosing the wrong man <>
the mood of the film is gloomy when a laugh is heard or someone does something silly it is monumental and takes on an unreal scope <>
the feeling one gets is somewhat as if a child saddened by the outside world is nevertheless able to laugh at something he makes up and thereby feels good about himself <>
when giordano is asked by the sacristan whether she has come to pray to have a child or to not have one she says she is just looking <>
the sacristans response is what are you here for then <>
the implication being that a womans duty is to raise kids <>
but what is even eerier than her evasive response is that oleg who insisted on coming here chooses not to even go inside the church <>
it would seem that he is making a statement to the effect that he suddenly realizes amidst such a religious setting that what he wants to find is not outside of himself that he cannot be a tourist anymore he must look inside himself to find what he is looking for <>
{1} he meets his kindred spirit in a madman a former math teacher erland with gloom and doom prophesies for the world who locks his family in the house for seven years for their own safety before someone breaks the door down and they escape and as one guest in the luxurious hotel oleg is staying at says the child runs out of there like a rat from his cage <>
these two hit it off they see something in each other that is akin in spirit <>
at first erland is reluctant to talk about what he did but when oleg pursues him to his house which is damaged and flooded from a leaky roof their conversation becomes surreal as both recognize in each other that they are possessed to do what it is they seem compelled to do and nothing can stop them <>
when erland gives a prophetic speech in rome and then torches himself to death to the accompaniment of music as his parishoners stand impassively by and only his dog shows feelings for what is happening to him we are struck with feelings of empathy and wonder about someone who is so sensitive yet is not sensitive enough to function in a world that is so apathetic to the sufferings in others <>
his suicide is a harsh opinion on orthodox religions failing role in getting him to alleviate that suffering and how it is quite necessary that we learn ourselves how to humble ourself before we relate to god otherwise there can be no proper cure for our disease <>
{1} the best and truest lines in the film are spoken by the madman <>
the poet is inarticulate taken aback by his memories and loss of spirit <>
all the other people he meets on this journey he forms only an allegorical relationship with whether its the translator or churchmen or hotel guests or the italian workers they all have little to say to him <>
the people are much like the weathermen who can give you the temperature but are lost when the conversation takes a deeper turn they are simply not prepared to talk about what they do not comprehend <>
for tarkovsky this film is a lifetime journey made by someone who is in pain and must see this pain through for what it is because there is no going ahead without taking this pain with him <>
he must also be prepared to take care of his spiritual obligations <>
since tarkovsky for all intensive purposes is a projection at least for this film of oleg as he envisions his life passing before him and is in anguish as he sees his faith being tested and as he starts to take hold of his fragile life maybe for the first time in his long life he seems like a changed person who recognizes his melancholy to be a death wish something that poetically inspires him something that is necessary <>
{1} things do not seem so foreign to him anymore <>
he knows now that he can travel anywhere in the world without a translator as he lights the candles in the holy water at the hotel and carries out the promise he made to erland when they conversed in his house <>
the flames are important reminders to him about what he must do to cleanse himself as he takes the lit candles over the baths in his cupped hands he believes they can burn away the core of the material world and give him hope for purity and an eternal life <>
the film ends in light as through the open circular window of a ruined church the sun shines in and metaphorically erlands house is transposed in it symbolizing his divided state <>
and as oleg begins to meditatively see who he is inside these literary structures he realizes that he is whole again and that he will return to his native russia that he loves so dearly that is inside his blood and he knows for certain now that it will be there for him forever wherever he goes <>

{2} what we have is a very cleverly done film that is in it for the boxoffice and as an entertainment only film and it should accomplish both aims at least entertainment wise it is firstrate <>
it is a good mindless violent flick for americans to take their mind off the more serious things occuring at the time this movie opened such as the political scandal and impeachment hearings involving our prez and his lady intern and you know how serious that stuff was <>
{1} to get into the spirit of the film you must suspend your belief in logic and accept this as a hero fantasy story with the hero being a tainted one basically fighting for his own pride and perverted sense of ethics as he figures his life is worth that being the figure he is owed by his partner in crime val gregg a sadomasochist with no redeeming human qualities who along with porter mel has robbed an oriental crime family to get the unsavory dough before he doublecrossed porter and supposedly had him killed <>
but do remember the bad hero is not all that bad he is mel the charming hero of countless adventure films a guy who is full of good looks and charm someone audiences love to like and will plunk down their money to see his films in huge numbers <>
he also does the voiceover ala noir style in a deep laconic voice you know like a sam spade would do it <>
the voiceover reassured me that he will live through the film <>
thats good because knowing him he will be in every scene of this flick and therefore im assured that i will be getting my moneys worth of mel <>
you see i dont really care what happens to his character in this flick per se since he is as unreal as the ones you find in the cartoons <>
what i care about is being entertained by golly golly golly gee <>
{-1} payback rips off the way a noir film is shot and looks or maybe in a certain sense pays it homage and does it with pizzazz <>
the big city it chooses for its locale is chicago with its tall buildings and el trains adding a dark shade to its story <>
the only thing it fails to pick up from those great bw films mood pieces of edginess from the s and s is that their heroes were really underdogs they were fighting the system not out for their own ends and vanity only <>
this little difference is easy to ignore but it is bothersome when i see how close mel came to sniffing out the essence of a noir film <>
but im glad to report ever so close but no cigar tough guy <>
you just cant imitate that secret ingredient without being into the real thing <>
so take your clams you will extract from the outfit and enjoy that money with the reformed whore with a heart of mush rosie maria you both deserve it <>
you were both great to look at on screen you played your hands well and most importantly i enjoyed the film it had a lightness to it that made it very appealing <>
{-1} needless to say there was not much to the plot for this stylish film but for those of you who want to know the story line this is a pure revenge film <>
porter after being setup by his junkie wife lynn deborah and val who needs a to square things with the outfit and get back into the organization where he can really get good money and protection from the mob <>
the action scenes of this heist are super <>
porter notices that the gang is not wearing their seat belts so on their rounds when they are carrying the loot he crashes headon to them killing them and then robbing them of the loot <>
then val does his doublecross as porters wife shoots her hubby taking all the money which happens to be <>
that is why our hero insists on only getting back the sum he believes he is ethically owed for the work he did <>
this gag lends a much welcomed humor to what could have been just a pointless actioner <>
at least the filmmakers are having fun with this one and it shows <>
{1} for the remainder of this slick film porter is either getting beat up or doing the beatings himself <>
in between there are assorted killings the traditional way with a heater <>
but there is also a car full of mobsters getting blown up and some get blown up via the phone <>
there is plenty of action so dont worry you dont have to think of anything when you are watching this flick everything moves at breakneck speed <>
a duo of corrupt cops get into the act one black the other white very political correct i must say <>
these filmmakers have a great eye for detail <>
and there is a sleaze ball drug dealer paymer the one who sells bad heroin to porters dear wife <>
he turns out to be the man porter uses to contact val upon his return from the dead <>
then there is the oriental gang and their interest turns to porter when they are tipped off that he robbed them <>
so allinall you have a lot of good action scenes going down a lot of funny oneliners i laughed out loud when porter said if i was any dumber i would have become a cop you see porter is acting very dumb going after the mob and its big bosses kristofferson coburn and devane <>
i especially liked seeing devane he is a throwback to the old noir foils <>
there is also an homage scene or a rip off which ever you prefer it doesnt matter to me when porter rips the earring off a drug dealers ear taking a chunk of his ear with it <>
you cant help remembering roman polansky did that in chinatown a true modern noir film a film that caught the essence of that genre <>
{1} the filmmakers are first time director and former screen writer of l a confidential brian helgeland <>
the film is based on a novel the hunter by richard stark <>
the film works for all the above reasons and most of all it works because mel is great for the part <>

{1} another feel good type foreign movie ala the full monty that seems to please the audience drawing in enough crowds to turn a nifty profit for its independent producers and is good enough so that the critics are very generous in their praises playing down the films bland politics <>
{1} a quaint irish village replete with ordinary type of folks as eccentrics a clever little plot with a few surprises thrown in for down the road a bunch of likable locals colorful scenery wonderful irish pipes heard in the background and it all adds up to a gentle and charming little film with no deep messages or symbolism attached to it <>
though the name devine is pretty close to divine the subject of religion is dealt with in a lighter manner as the visiting priest dermot tells the young boy hickey that he works for jesus and the kid retorts that he wouldnt work for anyone who doesnt pay him or for someone he never met <>
{0} the only serious flaw in the film is a contrived phone booth scene towards the end of the movie <>
that scene absolves the film from dealing with any bigger moral questions it might have raised by getting rid of the fly in the ointment the one character in the village that upset its tranquility <>
the strength in the film lies in the great acting job accomplished by the townfolks especially ian bannen jackie oshea david kelly michael osullivan and fionnula flanagan annie oshea <>
they gave the film a rich quality that goes beyond the story line and the moral implications of the scam that they perpetrated <>
{1} someone in this small village of people tullymore is reported as the winner of the irish lottery worth close to million pounds <>
but when no one claims it jackie becomes suspicious of who that could be <>
he discovers it is the elderly loner ned devine who has dropped dead from shock still clutching the ticket in his hand when jackie visits his house <>
so he recruits the help of his dear friend michael to act as the dead ned devine so that they can fool the lottery people and collect the winnings <>
michael is a genuine character who steals the picture with a classic comical motorcycle ride in the nude as he races down some backroads to beat the lottery man brendan to ned devines house <>
but they soon realize that they will have to tell the rest of the town their plan in order for this to work <>
they get everyone in town in line but for one nasty old woman dromey who is deemed the towns witch to agree that they will split the money equally and they will swear to the lottery people that michael is ned <>
{0} life in the village goes on in its routine way and we get to see some of the jealousies that exist in town the class differences and how quiet and set in its ways the townfolks really are <>
and of course there is a wee bit of gossip in the air <>
maggie lynch has a young boy and no husband <>
she has a few suitors but has not told them who is the childs father <>
the suitor she is most interested in is pig finn nesbitt but she will not marry the hard working lad because he smells like his pigs <>
{1} the twist in the story is interesting and if you have not seen the film and do not want to know this twist please skip the following paragraph and go directly to my grade rating of the movie <>
{1} well the kids father turns out to be none other than ned devine <>
by right maggie could have claimed all of the lottery winnings but decides it is better that the kid have someone he can call a father who will raise him than all the money from the lottery ticket <>
besides her share of the winnings would suit her fine <>
so she agrees to marry pig and he promises to give up raising pigs <>
now tell me how many films have you seen lately that can get away with such a corny but happy ending and still be critically wellthought of <>

[17116/b+]
{-1} happiness is not a film about happiness because happiness is not real but imagined therefore no one can stay happy in a world where sadness is the more prevalent emotional state <>
so goes the theme of this dark comedy meant to shock and antagonize you into looking at people you cannot readily identify with in a film that features a pedophile rapist dylan a murderer camyrn an obscene caller hoffman a masturbator read a russian immigrant thief jared and an assortment of losers and lonely people wrapped up in their egos as solondzs morbid sense of humor turns to new jerseys suburbs to explore the depravity of the human race <>
{1} this is an honestly made film that refuses to compromise on its plot or who should be cast in it solondz refused the studios offer to cast the pedophile with a noted star such as william hurt because he felt dylan was just right for the role <>
this film is meant for an art house type of audience one that is able as difficult as it may be to see something in themselves in the characters portrayed on screen <>
i would wonder about anyone who could sit through this film and not be disturbed by it that would just defeat its purpose <>
the audience i saw this film with were mostly williams college students and faculty and they laughed openly and freely at the parts that had an edge to it where solondz was going for the laugh because he pushed the button as far as he wanted to go with a certain character and in order to return to the intensely grim psychological mood of the story he had to release some humorous energy or have the film drown in its own murky waters <>
the laughter was appropriate and even hip as it felt right to see this with an audience that still felt the need to be entertained when they go to the movies and it didnt seem to matter if the laughter came about from the cruel humor it evoked causing people to react as a group rather than individually <>
i found that most people in the audience appeared to be nervously silent and there was at no time just one person alone laughing but the best part is that only one person walked out of the theater and no one hissed <>
{-1} happiness is a difficult picture to watch there are no good guys or gals <>
in order for it to work as a complete film one has to accept the interrelated tales of three different types of sisters and their relationship with their miserable parents gazzara and lasser who dont love each other and are not happy whatever they do he has given up on everything including getting a divorce and she feels a need to cling to this loveless marriage no matter what <>
{0} the sisters all suffer from egocentredness and it takes an audience with a modicum of sympathy for each of them to get past all the vices each of them has as each one in this story only pretends to be interested in anyone but themselves <>
{1} jane adams plays joy who is anything but joyous as she cries through most of the film having no luck at finding the right job or man <>
trish cynthia is the oldest and seemingly the most content parroting all the facile virtues of middle america living out the american dream with her three wonderful kids and successful psychologist husband dylan who is gentle and understanding but hides from her the fact that he is a pervert and a pedophile <>
it is also interesting to note in the analysis he undergoes that he only tells his analyst the dreams he wants to tell seemingly to satisfy the analyst and not damage his career while he neglects to tell the analyst his true sexual feelings <>
solondz closes the door for any of his characters to get the help they need <>
{0} lara flynn boyle plays helen the successful author who cant stand who she is who is so full of herself constantly harping to her sisters how she has been with so many good looking men and is never lonely but complains that she just has too much to do <>
she is also materially very welloff and condescending to her sisters <>
this illusion of her good life is shattered when an obscene caller a nerdy computer guy hoffman turns her on with one of his calls and she makes a date with him even after he hangs up on her but he is apparently afraid of her too willing response to his proposition so their relationship fizzles out <>
by chance he is also undergoing analysis with our shrink dylan so you know what kind of help he is getting for his problems <>
{1} the most poignant and unflinching scenes in the film are between the accused pedophile father and his son read as dylan who is superb in his role honestly counsels his yearold son about masturbation and later on has the difficult task of telling his son that he drugged and raped his sons friend and then raped one of his other friends and would do it again because he cant control himself <>
i could understand people being upset with this character as this character is given a forum to tell us what he is about and as difficult as it is to feel anything but contempt for him we at least see what this type of person looks like up close and we can ascertain that he is human no other film to my knowledge has done this so thoroughly and has done it so humanely and perceptively in fact very few films would have enough balls to touch this subject langs m with peter lorre does to a certain degree but langs film was different in nature and just touched bases with the peripheral nature of the problem he never pushed it to the front of the film and into the face of the audience his was mostly a noir crime story while solondzs film centers on exploring ones disturbing emotional states <>
{1} this is a very solid film that is wellacted that is understandably not for everyone yet because it takes risks on subjects that are tabu and even though some of the risks seemed contrived and not a part of the natural story line this is still a powerful film one deserving of attention and intelligent critique one deserving of thanks from those of us who welcome a true effort for the sake of art even if the art has to sink into the mud to have its story told <>
many filmmakers have approached the subject of happiness by tacking on a happy ending to their films <>
that is not the case with this film obviously <>
this film leaves you little choice you can take this film as morbid and amusing as it is or you can ignore it or you can find no one in it that you feel some sort of compassion for and therefore come to hate it <>
i came close to loving it while not exactly loving it mainly because there were too many scenes in it that left me with mixed feelings and messages <>
but close to loving it means i liked it a lot for its honesty to subject matter and character <>
i did however think that these characters went too far in their portrayals for me to relate to them without either feeling sorry for them or despising them <>

{2} how many other directors could handle with great deftness the innuendoes of this potentially sexually explosive relationship between an attractive and problematic widow with a young daughter emmanuelle and a handsome yearold priest belmondo during the german occupation of a small french town <>
melville establishes his exquisite control of the subject matter by allowing the story to unfold in such a perfect manner <>
i suspect not many directors have that kind of grace and understanding of life <>
melvilles sense of how to tell a story has influenced many directors through his long career starting in the late s and that list would include the great director bresson who developed the same style and feel for filmmaking as melville who at times outdoes melvilles melville giving some the false impression that melville imitated bresson <>
{2} melvilles success comes through the intelligent use he makes of his eye for seeing what is spiritual and what is intelligent and allowing it to be emotionally compelling <>
his characterization of the occupation and how some survived it by becoming collaborators with the germans or by becoming part of the black market or by becoming part of the resistance movement is accomplished by relating the priest to all that goes on in town and how the priest brings out his ideas of what god is and how tolerance is the message of all sane people even as the horrors of what the nazis stand for is glossed over in the background its evil is still felt by those who must live under them meanwhile melville is connecting the religious needs of the community and the deportation of the jews with the personal savior jesus christ who he reminds us died as a jew <>
the implication being for those who think that because they are christians they dont have to be concerned about what is happening to the jews are sorely mistaken because they have forgotten who christ is and how he died for everyone and how if he was around today he would be a jew taken away to the death camps <>
the priest sees his task in life as a fulfillment of his christian vows by helping those who need to be helped no matter what they believe in <>
he appeals especially to the women in town as a sort of modern day christ that results in some very complex emotional questions being raised relating to mundane matters and affairs of the heart and spiritual quests <>
{2} belmondos performance as a priest who questions authority and is not afraid of what others might think is superb as he attracts many women practitioners especially leaving himself vulnerable to public opinion when he openly maintains a very close relationship with the widow <>
his argument for a god couldnt be put forth with more verve and intelligence even though it didnt convince me as he was not challenged with counter arguments by any one in the film who had the ability to present a cogent differing opinion nevertheless this film moved me to further expand what i think <>
it even shows that it is possible to have a truly spiritual person be a part of the church something that i have rarely come across outside the cinema <>

{2} this is top notch filmmaking by a director who when he is on the mark is as good as anyone in the business <>
sthane audran is frique a wealthy woman with lesbian leanings who on a whim picks up a young attractive impoverished parisian sidewalk artist with the unusual name of why sassard <>
she takes her to her other home in st tropez and introduces her to how the wealthy live <>
what complicates their relationship even further is the arrival of paul trintignant a handsome and talented architect who immediately makes love with why but soon finds he has more in common with frique so the two of them become lovers <>
paul shows a keen interest in having a bisexual menageatrois but frique is determined to keep him for herself <>
{0} the film is divided into a number of segments that ask questions about the lead characters questions they cannot readily ask about themselves <>
{0} that chabrol has the audacity to weave a story around these three diverse characters each searching for something inside them that remains a mystery to them plays well against the unmitigated sexual yearnings and need to experience sex these three have in common <>
it is a way to look at the s that is through the lenses of these materialists who seemed to shun that periods more typical cultural revolution <>
the womens search is a personal one it is for some kind of comfort that can take away their loneliness <>
by all indications they could care less about art or the world <>
why knows she is not a good artist and frique could care less <>
pauls search remains more of a mystery as his only other interest besides these two women is the love he has for his work <>
{0} though the sex is not explicit its tenseness is what is felt as an obsession as frique and paul feel a happiness in their love that fills a void in their life that they couldnt find before <>
why is the odd one out but cant accept her fate as she begins to transform changing her look and style so that she could become a clone for frique <>
once she has tasted this lifestyle she cant go back to being a virgin sidewalk artist again <>
paul being the most intuitive of the three senses a danger in the house which also has two gay robue and riais freeloading sychophants there who are nasty sorts having outlived their usefulness to frique and are asked by her unceremoniously to leave <>
{1} what makes this one of chabrols better films is the unexpected resources of the characters to pull off this emotionally draining story the females the very fragile does of the film and the male who is the hunter wrestle with the ambiguities of their sexual intentions and inclinations as it leads up to the tragic ending <>
their emotionally desperate situation always seems to be one step beyond their reach as they get deeper and deeper into an unresolvable situation with the film ending on its bleakest note with a certain amount of vagueness still remaining that is befitting a film that has told its story with all the style and clarity it could muster <>

{1} a cold thriller exploring the exploitation of violence by heaping up a huge quantity of exploitive violence itself to make some points about what is the publics attitude and tolerance level for the random violence that is present in society <>
in other words this is an exploitive violent film railing against exploitive violent films if that makes sense <>
it holds to the socalled philosophy of fighting fire with fire <>
by crafting an intelligent screenplay and not going for the unnecessary showing of gore much of this is done offscreen which might be almost as horrific as seeing the actual mayhem the director is able to keep the film arty <>
but by playing with the publics prurient interest in violence as a way of life something they have been numbed into accepting as part of their television and mtv inheritance this powerful story has a chilling affect on rationality questioning the viewing habits and the responses to violence the public has <>
{0} this film is about a wealthy welleducated couple georg and anna ulrich and suzanne and their young son georg jr stefan going to their isolated luxurious lakeside summer resort home to do some boating golfing and escape from the summer heat <>
a polite cleancut intruder peter frank comes in to borrow eggs from them for their neighbor and wont leave turning rude as his partner also cleancut paul arno soon arrives to torment the couple smacking georgs knee with a golf club so that he is disabled for the remainder of this hostage situation and is unable to properly defend his family <>
there is also the most riveting scene in the movie where anna is forced to strip subject to possible rape while her son is blindfolded and her husband is forced to answer ridiculous questions <>
the hostage situation is barely watchable the mental torture the couple is put through is sickening these psychologically sadistic murderers offer no true explanation for their actions using mockery and cynical responses to mask the power trip they are on <>
they have no redeeming human features and their cruel intent is played up for the cameras benefit paul even winks at the camera as if the audience is in on this game they are playing <>
in one of the scenes the camera is rewound when the audience is given the gratuitous pleasure in seeing one of the sadists killed but even this is not granted to the audience when the scene is finally rewound <>
{-1} what remains to be comprehended is how a family trying to survive and hold onto to their dignity can manage in the best way they can as these misfits play games with them pretending to give them choices in choosing their suffering but always telling them that they will kill them before they leave <>
these thugs are complete fakes even their names are fictitious as they keep referring to themselves with different names such as tom and jerry beavis and butthead <>
paul calls peter fatty several times to the mock displeasure of peter tom beavis or whoever this obese snide monster really is <>
everything about these two is a facade their phony stories of who they are and how they were brought up their pretenses at politeness add up to zero for an audience that is left dismayed realizing that it is only their evil that is real in this film despite the directors aim to fictionalize the reality of this fictitious situation to reduce everyone to a cartoon image to make it appear that we can grow to expect violence as a natural part of life <>
that part doesnt work as well as the director might think it does <>
the family is real to the audience <>
georgs lack of courage and quiet in the face of danger leaves him distraught unable to face himself <>
annas resolute behavior and her human foibles make us sympathize with her even more so even if we are not particularly enamored by the way she deports herself when she is in control of things and the sons confusion touches us deeply as we see him look for direction to his now helpless parents a nightmare for any parent to be in a situation where you cant protect your child <>
{-2} i am left with the choice of how to rate the movie knowing full well that the sophist argument is if you dont like what you are seeing then dont see the rest of it <>
thats well and good <>
and if that is your philosophy on how to how to handle exploitive material i cant condemn you for it <>
i would think that many people of sound mind would feel this way and will walk out of the theater <>
but i dont think as the director thinks in an interview he gave that people who stay to see the entire movie really need the movie <>
i dont necessarily need this movie <>
i stayed to see if this sadistic film works its point of view out and i was disappointed that with all its novelty and games and pretenses to high art it offered nothing much in the way of seeing things differently <>
the film is successful not because of its message but because it is a wellcrafted film from a filmmaker who knows how to make films even if he pretends to be doing more than he is capable of <>
this film succeeds with the small share of the audience it can garner because it is surprisingly enough an entertaining film and it broaches a subject that is very difficult to understand that tweaks our interest in seeing if there is anything new to say about violence <>
and the hope is that we might be able to understand violence a little bit better even if it has to come to us by way of an unorthodox position and that maybe since violent films are so universally popular we can somehow see the human condition on film and not be anesthetized by the reality of violence <>
{0} as far as the critical success of this film goes i think it is merely a better version of all those halloween grizzly killing pictures we are subjected to if you want a high class texas chainsaw massacre film <>

{1} the world is a hard place is the theme that runs through sayles well thoughtout political film about a capable upperclass but naive doctor from the city of some hypothetical latin american country <>
the part of the doctor is played by the distinguished looking whitehaired argentinean luppi <>
the doctor has trained some students to be doctors in the remote mountainous areas where the indians live under the auspicies of a specially funded program <>
he hasnt heard from them since they left and is now anxious to visit them on his vacation and see how they are doing before he retires <>
he takes his fancy wheeler and makes the difficult trek to this impoverished region in order to see what his legacy will be <>
he is concerned about leaving a legacy before he dies <>
he is filled with pride about his accomplishments but this pride turns to agony as he slowly realizes that all the doctors he has trained have been assassinated and that he has sent them to their deaths by not preparing them for the realities of their job <>
{0} on his journey to find the political truth the doctor picks up some travelling companions who in turn add their tales of woe to the horrors of living in such a bad political climate <>
from the orphan boy dan he meets in the starving indian village he learns how little the people have how ruthless both the army which is made up of mostly indian soldiers and the guerillas are <>
these are the men with guns they will kill anyone whether they have a reason to or not <>
the white plantation owners are the exploiters of the people keeping them working at unreasonably low wages <>
{0} the boy turns out to be useful to the doctor because he speaks the native language and he knows how to find his way in spots where there are no visible roads <>
the army deserter delgado robs the doctor and then kidnaps him and through the use of flashbacks we see how he participated as a medic in the army in violence and murder of the villagers <>
{0} a priest hitches a ride and tells his story of losing faith while working with the villagers and no longer considers himself a priest <>
he does not see what good religion can do in such a repressive area as the doctor questions him and states that a person must believe in something <>
{0} and finally a mute young lady who has been raped by the soldiers and subsequently has stopped speaking comes along with them hoping to find a secure place to live <>
{0} a talkative american couple mandy and kathryn interested in the ancient civilization of this country but unable to comprehend what is going down for the current indians living here strike a chord for all those who should see what is taking place but cant and this is because they cant face what is right in front of them but because they are living charmed lives they will return to their country unscathed by all the atrocities around them <>
{-1} the doctor is the eyes and ears for what is going on <>
his slow but steady transformation into political awareness is the most reassuring omen sent out in this nondidactic straight forward ambitious project of sayles <>
he does not glorify the indians the ones who are the most cruelly treated <>
he shows how unopen and hostile they can be to visitors and how when given a chance to get a better life they will do anything to escape even kill their own people <>
the strength that comes from such a story is in the telling of it and the powerful images presented <>
the problem with all this is that since no specific country was named it must mean that sayles considers this to be a universal problem and that makes the problem gigantic with no one to be specifically blamed especially since these kind of human abuses have been going on for ages it becomes difficult to zero in on what can be done to prevent such happenings <>
the other problem is that one can get the feeling that there reaches a point where one feels he is being manipulated that there is so little that can be done by individuals alone that governments have to be held accountable for their actions and people have to be aware of what their governments are doing even if most of all people have to learn how to help themselves <>
{1} this is a very strong independent minded picture that chooses to tell a very difficult story one that not many people will take comfort in <>
but the question arises as to how the message of such despair will get out to people who are so far removed from that isolated part of the world <>
it seems that this film might have some influence but there is little that individuals who are not from that region can do as proof we have just to look at the terrors faced by those in this film who tried to help <>

{1} this is a simple childlike nonpolitical iranian neorealism film told from the vantage point of a yearold girl aida who desires a fat goldfish in the shop which costs tomans instead of the skinny ones she has at home for the new year celebration which comes on the first day of spring <>
goldfish for the iranian celebrants are symbols of life <>
{2} what is truly amazing about this masterly done film is how gracefully it uses real time to take you into the countdown for the new year that is marked off by repeated radio reminders <>
meanwhile a small radius of tehran that is familiar to the girl but not really known to her is seen through her wideopen eyes as she walks home from shopping with her mother sadr <>
she is constantly watched by her mother but is childishly curious about the shops and the group of men who hangout around the snake charmers a place she is forbidden to go to <>
when they arrive home we are not invited inside their home as if we were intruders but we see their courtyard and we get a pretty good idea how this middleclass family lives <>
{0} her mother is upset with her because she did not follow her closely while shopping and because she cant stop talking and whining about the chubby goldfish she wants to buy begging her to give her the money to buy the goldfish <>
at home we meet her older brother mohsen who returns from an errand for his father who is not seen because he is showering but we hear him get angry at moshen for bringing him soap instead of shampoo <>
{0} the brother thinks she is crazy to want the goldfish he tells her you can see two movies for that amount of money <>
but she is not dissuaded and manages to bribe her brother by giving him her blue balloon and he talks his mother into giving him a toman note to purchase the fish if he brings back the change <>
when he returns with the banknote he is surprised as aida grabs the money and rushes out to purchase the fish going against her mothers wishes to be out alone in the streets of tehran <>
{1} she remeets the snake charmers and her curiousity cant resist watching them <>
they cheat her out of her money but she manages to get the money back from them <>
by this time we are sucked into accepting the importance the money and goldfish has for the girl it is not unlike our christmas time desire to please our children with gifts whether or not the gifts are worth it or not they have an intrinsic value above their real worth and we feel so happy when we see the joy in their eyes when they receive their gifts <>
the brilliance of the film is that the story that unfolds is about the little girls adventure with the shop owners and the strangers in the street she is not supposed to talk to but does and how caught up in it we get because it is so human a story it is something that is universally understood that we forget that we are talking about iran the country that we demonized our arch enemy and if the film can be criticized it is for glossing over any of the numerous wrongs in their society that could be criticized but are not <>
though i think that might be unfair to say since the movie should be judged for its own sake and not for any outside political reasons <>
{1} she once again loses the banknote it falls down a street grating and she cant get it out <>
thusly we meet a tailor who is arguing with a customer and from the girls anxious eyes we see how gigantic and aloof adults can be to a child especially when she cant wait to tell him about the lost money that fell down the grating but he doesnt listen to her <>
it is interesting to see how different he can be when another adult an older woman talks to the tailor in behalf of the little girl <>
{0} the remainder of the film is about her attempt to recover the money with her brother now by her side <>
{1} finally an afghan balloon seller is recruited to help recover the banknote <>
he helps them accomplish the task but when this is done the girl and her brother run off gleefully to their home to celebrate the new year and the busy street starts to empty out as everyone is rushing home <>
the final shot as the film ends is of the afghan boy smiling just seconds ago now saddened alone with just one white balloon that he did not sell and we realize that this film ends with our impression of him on our minds and the little girls adventure seems to be just one little story told and now we can easily forget about her but the afghans plight his loneliness remains etched in our mind as it affects the sensiblities we have about family life and makes us reflect what it is to be a foreigner in a country where family life is so cherished and it leaves us thinking not about any of the celebrants but about what is going to happen to him how will he celebrate the new year <>
this is a great final shot of the white balloon in the air that is not contrived or pretentious but is genuinely a heartfelt and memorable moment of the film topping off a very human film that might surprise a lot of people that it was made in modern iran <>
{2} the white balloon is a masterpiece in its simplicity and the way its tale of the human condition is so easily related without demeaning the people involved and how childhood is explored pointing out how a child tries to grow up when faced with adversity are unmatched in most hollywood films <>
if i had to compare it to any film that i have seen i think of de sicas the bicycle thief and see some of the same values about life in both films <>

{2} can you imagine that this innovative creative film a groundbreaker for its time managed to virtually end the career of its great and noted director as the subjects sexual content was too much to take for so many of the selfrighteous critics of that time <>
this is a film about scoptophilia voyeurism the morbid urge to gaze or as it is more commonly called being a peeping tom <>
{0} mark lewis carl is a cameraman with a great psychological problem he is fixated on taking pictures of females bringing on a fear in them by pointing a spear at them then having them watch themselves in a mirror as he kills them <>
his father was a scientist who experimented with mark when he was young by filming him constantly shining lights in his eyes to wake him from sleep throwing lizards in his bed and always testing his young son to see how he reacts to fear <>
when marks mother dies the father michael powell plays this part in the home movies shown quickly remarries upsetting the youngster even further <>
he gives mark a camera as a gift and this starts marks obsession with voyeurism <>
{0} when his father dies mark inherits the house which he rents out to an assortment of tenants <>
coming home one evening a st birthday party is being given for one of the tenants helen anna who is strangely attracted to this very shy awkward man who she doesnt realize is the landlord <>
she visits him in his apartment and he takes her into his darkroom and shows her his ghastly home movies <>
and even though he acts very peculiar she remains interested in him and he shows that he likes her and will not harm her <>
{0} meanwhile there is a murder that occurs in the same style as the previous one reported in the newspapera where the victim has died with a dreaded look of fear this one takes place in the film studio where he works as a focuser which brings in the police to investigate <>
on his other job where he works for a newstand dealer he takes pictures of models who pose for him in sexually alluring ways <>
he murders one of the models knowing full well that the police are tailing him <>
he even films the police as they are closing in to catch him <>
he says that this is all part of the documentary he is shooting <>
{2} mark lewis is this pathetically gentle psychopath who has a compulsion to kill brought on by his early childhood years who cannot even be saved by love as his compulsion to kill and die is stronger than anything else <>
this fascinating film is as intensely good as any thriller done by hitchcock or chabrol <>
its intensity and compelling characterization of mark is a landmark in films <>

[17146/b]
{1} this intelligent and emotionally moving film is based on the truelife story as recorded in the autobiography a genius in the family written by one of the musical prodigy english sisters hilary rachel the flautist in the du pre family <>
jackie emily is the younger sister the one who reaches fame as a virtuoso cellist especially known for her interpretations of elgars compositions <>
the crux of the film is about their sisterly relationship their competition with each other and their need for each other as they were growing up in the s <>
the differences between them that eventually has them living disparate lives becomes the dramatic focal point of the film with jackie growing up to become the great musician who marries another celebrated musician daniel barenboim james but who is very unhappy for reasons that are very complex and not easily answered but thoroughly explored in the film leaving the audience to be the judge of what might have gone wrong while hilary finds bliss in domesticity giving up music to live in the country and raise chickens and children with her vibrant husband kiffer david <>
{2} the cast is superb <>
emily watson in the very difficult and trying role of a petulant genius searching for answers about herself plagued by selfdoubt that borders on madness and the need for close ties to home is brilliantly portrayed as she reveals jackies compelling character showing her supple musical knowhow and her erotic sexual liberation and her binding commitment to what she wants to pursue and towards the end of her life a spunky grit to deal with her debilitating illness of multiple sclerosis that will take her life in when she is just yearsold in a most unmerciful way <>
{1} it is rare that a film has such a meaty part for one woman to play <>
this film has two such parts <>
the other female lead is admirably played by rachel as she is solid in her role as the first prodigy child to shine brightly and as the jealous one when she realizes her sister has caught up with her talent wise and will soon surpass her <>
we can read her mind as she grapples with her inability to grow as a musician and when kiffer aggressively pursues her and weds her giving her the selfesteem she has always wanted she will cease to be a professional musician <>
{0} the girls never seemed taken with a genuine love of music except as it suited their talents <>
their strivings for success was at first a reason to be coddled by their ambitious stage mother celia then it became a chance for the sisters to remain close each sharing the spotlight and then something mysterious happened perhaps a twist of fate that allowed hilary to fall off the pedestal while the once weaker performer jackie took her practice to heart just to keep up with her older sister who now becomes recognized by the world for her musical talent <>
the stage father dance has a rather interesting role as the moralist in the family who is a bit of a stodgy kind of antisemite mom too whose bemused character might be summed up as he is reflecting on his daughters marriage to barenboim and conversion to the jewish religion she cant be jewish she is blond <>
{0} the film begins innocently on a deserted english beach where the sisters played by keely flanders and auriol evans happily frolic on the sand meeting a strange ghostlike woman who tells jackie in a whisper everything will be all right <>
this ominous tone sets a haunting mood for the film that will quickly move away from these seemingly happy days of their youth and take them to their adulthood where distance will separate them in a way that they could never have believed possible from their early upbringing <>
{1} the wellcrafted screenplay by frank cottrell boyce is ably directed by tucker who is directing his first feature film <>
the only fault i found with his direction is that i thought it was unnecessary to have duplicate scenes of what hilary and jackie experienced that is we didnt have to see it from each ones point of view <>
i thought the film would have been better served if the action was continuous the going back over the same scenes from a different point of view really killed the pace of the film slowing it down too much <>
the sisterly relationship was so powerful and subtle that when jackie runs away from barenboim for no apparent reason and winds up at hilarys remote country house and suggests to hilary that she allow her devoted husband to service her we are caught up in the intrigues of a very trying sibling rivalry that questions sensibility and ones mores all the while testing the sisters very genuine affection for each other <>
{2} this is a film that glows with confidence sparked by a maturity of material that tries to unravel some of the mysteries in life that make one wonder about certain decisions made that can impact ones entire life <>
the film worked so well because of the contrasts between the two female stars they prevented the film from burying itself in a pit of sadness and also it was deftly handled by the directors ability to keep the movie light not to make jackies situation into a downer <>
and the music helped it was simply marvelous <>

{2} paris as it was in for the lost generation of americans hemingway gertrude stein alice b toklas and all the other artists and would be artists seeking to make their name known on foreign soil <>
rudolph takes a rather cynical and tongueincheek view of that art scene capturing the mood and the atmosphere of that period shooting this highly entertaining and for him accessible film in a dazzling display of color representative of the art produced at that time by picasso cezanne matisse and modigliani <>
this was actually the first feature film he had in mind but had to wait to do it until he got backers <>
his love and understanding of this time period shows up very well as a result he creates his best film to date <>
{0} the plot of the film concerns love heartbreak money problems the meaning of art alcoholism and finding ones identity <>
nick hart carradine is the cartoonist for the chicago tribune living in a garret frequenting the parisian expatriate cafes trying to sell the paintings he works on with all his artistic skills and earning extra money by forging the paintings of the masters <>
oiseau shawn is his friend and colleague on the paper who writes a gossip column <>
{0} when nick sees the beautiful wife he never divorced rachel linda in a paris bar married to the ruthless and crass business man manufacturer of condoms and private art collector bertram lone he tries to win her back <>
she is dissipated unhappy with the direction of her life becoming an alcoholic and ashamed that she is married to a very cruel and despicable man <>
{0} libby bujold is a smalltime art dealer who tries unsuccessfully to sell nicks paintings <>
nathalie de ville chaplin is the insincere art collector wife of a husband that she cheats on while also hiring nick to forge three of her philandering husbands collection of masters for the nefarious purpose of getting even with him <>
the parisian scene is topped off by an emotionally sentimental hemingway oconnor showing up at all the right parties sitting at the right cafes drinking to excess and plying his craft while thinking aloud as his philosphy comes off as just so much drivel with him appearing shallow and hopelessly american despite his presence in paris at precisely the right time for an american to be there <>
gertrude stein elsa and her friend alice ali come off as snobs in love with their own sense of selfimportance <>
{-1} though the story might falter at times with unneeded boxing matches and stereotyped tourists providing unneeded insights into the parisian scene what never faltered was how well this film looked and how engagingly it caught the ironies of that period <>

{-1} we need myths to live by says the heroine of this film estelle randy danson <>
and somehow rappaport concocts a mythic love tale around this premise that is similar in some aspects to the orpheus and eurydice myth whereas orpheus rescued his love from hades but even though he was told by the gods not to look back or she would disappear he did look back because of his insecurities and fear that eurydice would think that he didnt care for her anymore <>
{0} the estranged relationship of the sisters estelle and lena jones is somewhat reconciled as they start living together after a long absence from one another mainly because estelle feels guilty about how she treated her sister before <>
so she lets her live with her even though she would rather not have her there <>
soon they find themselves in the delicate position of having gone out with the same man an extremely muted man paul kevin who forms a relationship with each of the sisters first with estelle and then by coincidence he meets lena but fails to fulfill his fantasy of having a sexual relationship with both of them at the same time <>
{0} this film is distinguished by its stylish use of opera classical painting and victorian soap opera likedramatics to get across its strange wit and rilkeanlike observations of what can be seen from life when you become a passive observer of it <>
the observer is estelle who pictures herself as if she was the one she is seeing when she looks out at a world she feels imprisoned by <>
{1} it could be a very witty movie if you are receptive to the characters personality foibles as they mock or imitate what the reallife troubled modern heterosexuals in nyc are up to as paul acts out the part at being the tall dark silent type of macho heman who is animalistic in his attraction to both sisters estelle with her pretentious romantic soul who is endowed with beautiful breasts and her more down to earth sister who is not the romantic type but is more prosaic in her outlook toward life who is attractive but suffers from psychological problems and fits of violence <>
{0} violence somehow plays into the motifs of the story as there is talk of a serial killer on the loose in the city which prompts estelle to say she is afraid to go outside and she is afraid to stay inside <>
she even thinks that her exhusband jack grant might be the killer since he is prone to acting peculiarly hostile at times <>
but the killer is caught and it is not jack <>
{0} everyone in the film is a takeoff of what a real person might be like when they are going through a relationship or when encountering strangers in public places <>
as for the later lena confronts a stalker by coming on strong to him thusly chasing him away as he absurdly tells her he should get the cops on her <>
everyone is meant to be a cartoon character ones whom you can poke fun at especially when they take themselves seriously <>
{0} estelle provides the voiceover which underscores the striking visual scenery in the background like the starry sky wallpaper in her room that she is most comfortable with as she collects her thoughts from the diary she is writing mixing her keen observations about romance with comments such as men are attracted to women who wear a wedding band because it is like a challenge for them to conquer a married woman to her consuming jealousy and mistrust of others even those she once loved like jack paul and lena <>
{1} estelle becomes a sort of representative of all women who are bitchy wrongfully hurt in a relationship or too consumed in their fantasy world of what a guy should be like to ever form a lasting relationship <>
the films aim is to be humorous about this <>
even the final scene where she at lasts burns her diary similar to the women lib bra burnings can be taken both as comic or dramatic theatrics <>
in any case this is a very unusual and original work that is sometimes slowgoing missing the mark by being too outrageous and covering far too much ground for its own good but more often than not it is right on the mark using its token males paul as an insignificant stud a servicer of the female race and jack as an untrustworthy spouse perceived as being capable of violent acts as the sisters encompass the gamut of womanly wants in a man in a most peculiar way <>
{1} this film should appeal to urban dwellers who have been in a triangular heterosexual relationship and came out of it more confused than when first entering it and to those who have a more tolerant and sophisticated attitude toward impossible relationships <>
and as estelle so ably says after her burning ritual i need some new myths for my life the old ones dont work anymore <>
this film is a parody of the orpheus myth and as estelle says she gave paul two chances to get her out of hell but he failed both times orpheus was given only one chance <>
{1} incidently the funniest line in the movie is reserved for paul who tells estelle i wouldnt even tell you a lie much less the truth <>
i think that line summarizes what the movie is ultimately about <>

{-1} this buster keaton wannabe movie is supposedly a comedyromance about an inept morose oslo mailman roy skjaerstad who is not respected by his fellow workers and shows he is not satisfied with his job somehow taking this frustration out by not delivering heaps of mail which he dumps out regularly at some railroad underpass and by steaming open other letters and reading them <>
he is a sleaze a frequenter of porn book shops and lowlife night spots <>
his life is a dreary loveless mess <>
{0} as if all that is not bad enough certainly grounds for dismissal from the post office someone who would upset me if he was my mailman but to top that off he is also a voyeur finding the keys to a deaf she wears a hearing aid womans apartment that she left in the mailbox and using the key to enter her apartment when she is at work at her dry cleaning job to go through her things and steal a photograph of her <>
it seems he finds her attractive but doesnt know how to get to tell her this <>
she is played in a lowkey manner by andrine saether line <>
{0} this film is noted for showing the slum side to beautiful oslo where we see crime ugly buildings the subway and problems outsiders do not associate with this peaceful and scenic country <>
the crime we see is roy being robbed of his mailbag but his strap gets caught and he cant even get robbed properly later on saying he would have gladly given up the bag and avoided the beating the three muggers gave him that hospitalized him and made him out to be a postal hero for not wanting to give up the bag <>
the film spends most of the first half of the movie showing him to be a screw off everything he touches he fouls up a complete loser there is a long tradition of hollywood comedians who have exploited that avenue of comedy <>
his comic effect is a deadpan expression that absorbs all criticism that comes his way <>
his fellow postal workers rag him about what he is good for and a lady postal worker who wants to stick up for him can only say that he is a good walker which causes a round of snickers from the postal workers ragging him <>
what is funny is the way he looks at us as he looks at the camera showing us his hurt feelings and pathetic nature emphasizing to us that he is a natural screw up <>
{0} but the picture has darker ulterior motives than that it will chuck out all the work it did setting up the film as a fluff piece of comedy and go for the criminal aspects to the story a decision that has to change how we approach seeing this film we can no longer be content to relax laughing at this inept mailman we have to now see how he handles himself under fire while the director also tries to bring romance into the story <>
{0} the romance that comes to this film comes in a surprising way as roy is trapped in lines apartment when she comes home unexpectedly and he watches her nude as she goes to take a bath but what she is really doing is committing suicide <>
roy saves her by reviving her and calling for an ambulance leaving the house before she knows that it was him that saved her <>
there is a dark side to her that is now disclosed she is involved with a strongarm thug georg per who beat a security guard senseless in a robbery and gave line the money to hold for them <>
{-2} as far as i am concerned the film loses track of what it is capable of doing at this point of the story and it becomes a different film where one contrived situation after another occurs to keep the story suspenseful with the buffoonlike georg menacing roy <>
roy is now the subject of a film that doesnt know if it wants to be viewed as a suspense or romance yarn or just as a plain comedy <>
roy still acts with the same deadpan expression as a result everything becomes muddled and ridiculous <>
the laugh situations seem forced the romance absurd and the suspense unreal <>
{-1} at best i found this film to be a modest effort at comedy that results in a modest film barely being less than annoying but redeemed by showing me the darker side of oslo a side that i have not seen before on screen <>
so i think that this first time director who is guilty of trying to come up with too many different twists to the story and by relying on a hero to carry the film who is not very likable and a story line that is very thin has defeated the comic efforts that he was successful with during the first part of the film but by the end of the film wears down to a barely passable effort at comedy <>

{0} keitel if you stretch your gullability a bit is a great american film director returning to his native greece after years in the states <>
his controversial films receive high praise or condemnation from the crowds as this visually stunning film powerfully opens with keitel returning to the small village he was born in as its faceless people dressed in black come out in the open market at night to see a showing of his film in the rain now thats a real homage to films <>
there are also ominous riot police controlling the crowd in fully armed gear <>
keitels purpose for being there is twofold he is on a journey a la ulysses to reconstruct his past and he is also anxious to see if he can recover lost reels from the manakia brothers they were the first ones to shoot a film in greece <>
what fascinates him is that they saw the century come in with its hopes and aspirations they were not politically motivated but were interested in recording what went on with the people and the times they lived in what was right and wrong about those times regardless of the mess that resulted from the mistakes the politicians made <>
{0} this is an ostentacious and mesmerizing film about a film directors obsession with the importance film plays in recording history <>
it is also a film that is bleak and despairing as it goes on its long and weary journey over hostile territories where governments could never be anything but inhumane and where revolutions were betrayed and costly <>
what lingers on are the lasting images of isolated places that find in the silence of the landscape a chilling insanity of how cold the world can be <>
keitel leaves greece for albania crossing the border in a taxi taking along an old lady who has not seen her sister for years because of the war leaving her off in the most somber of albanian towns where she is alone to take in the grimness of the moment looking up at the cold buildings and deathlike quality to life as we leave her with a look of desperation on her face <>
{0} erland josephson plays many different roles as the actress who befriends keitel on his way out of albania and into bucharest in quest of the missing reels <>
in one of her roles she plays his mother as the mother would be in adjusting to life in war torn europe <>
this allows us to see what the director saw as a child <>
again it is a homage to how important it is to record history so that it cannot be forgotten <>
{0} the journey takes him to macedonia bulgaria belgrade and sarajevo <>
this allows for the film to wax poetic to become a meditation on the landscape to indulge our sense of the incomprehensible as we see what the filmmaker is seeing we all become foreigners in this eeriness in this lost century where the truth has been maimed <>
{0} its images are always powerful even if the dialogue seems superfluous and banal <>
sarajevo in the middle of the crazy ethnic cleansing war is an inhabitable place where snipers shoot at anything that moves <>
it is starkly photographed in the fog and in the rubble torn buildings where the people barely exist as they remain there hoping for miracles to get them by <>
we watch them rejoice in the welcomed fog that is welcomed because the snipers must stop shooting till it clears <>
the fog is the only place normalcy is allowed to be and even here the dangers are always in the background <>
that is the message delivered from this politically motivated and visually aesthetic film full of emotion and bereavement for what could have been but is now ruined by blind hatred <>
the film is tiresome at times too cliche ridden for the potent message it delivers for it be as great as its cinematography is <>

{-1} you can watch this movie that is based on a scifi work by robert heinlein either as a straight gungho war film or you can see it mostly as a spoof <>
anyway you watch it wont require too much gray matter from your brain cells because you will either find this film entertaining and a feast for weary eyes or you might like me think that this film is so bad that it really couldnt be this bad i must be missing something <>
but i have come to the conclusion that this insipid b movie is that bad despite the high production costs it took to make it <>
{-1} if there are any good parts to this film it might be in the occasional sardonic one liner such as this one that makes light of the films heavy assault on our sensibilities as one soldier is telling the hero of the story youre good at killing bugs <>
this came after a big battle between the two opposing armies <>
{-1} basically the film should be seen as a war movie because its spoof of the military grew thin very fast for me as it got carried away with the cartoon characters it has stereotyped going for an overkill on a spoof that is so obvious in the first place that by spending so much time with spoofing the military is just plain unnecessary <>
it is the last half of the film that takes over the movie anyway as the film becomes all about killing the bugs who have invaded a city called bueno aires <>
thats the town all our hero kids come from in the story <>
{-1} i guess the film is set in the future but it sure looks like the present to me despite all the computer graphics as it makes use of its astronomical budget to become solely a computerized special effect movie that should endear itself to the mtv generation <>
there is no subtlety to the continual spoofs against the military personnel <>
the mindless story traces a bunch of high school graduates and their dedicated teacher wellacted by michael ironside as they all join the military for all the reasons that prevail at the present time for why people join <>
{-1} after awhile all the performers looked alike to me but i wouldnt be doing my duty as a movie reviewer if i should fail to point out that there is some kind of melodramatic love story going down among the four stars of the film rico casper van dien the school football hero loves carmen denise richards the school beauty and math brain who is set on becoming a pilot which is the reason rico joins the military <>
there is some kind of mumbojumbo talk among them about the difference between a citizen and a civilian a citizen does his duty by joining the military and protecting the federation a civilian makes lots of money and goes to harvard as what ricos folks wanted him to do <>
the other part of the love story is that dizzy flores dina meyer a football jock and an attractive filly is in love with rico but he spurns her attention <>
but persistence pays off she joins him in the infantry while carmen falls for her copilot a dude named zander patrick muldoon and the rivalry between rico and zander is about as thrilling as having a spider crawl up your leg <>
{-1} i dont think you get much bang for your money out of this film unless you are really into special effects or found this sophomoric satire funny or you are a reactionary then i think you will find many things to like about this empty hearted attempt to put ww into an outer space conflagration film <>

{0} a young northern iranian schoolboy ahmed wishes to return a school notebook to his classmate who is threatened with expulsion from school if he does not bring in his notebook to school for tomorrows class <>
the problem is that the student lives in the next village and ahmed does not know his address <>
how he gets the notebook to his friends house turns out to be an odyssey of great human endeavor as this yearold looks through wanting eyes at an adult world that is trapped in its own misconceptions <>
ahmed has to overcome his mothers harsh outlook on life his grandfathers caustic perception of how to raise a child his strict school teacher and the adults he meets on the way who are unconcerned with his problem <>
{1} that ahmed goes on to the next village despite warnings of not to go is a metaphor for how a childlike curiousity and a refreshing innocense is the essential ingredient needed if change is ever to come to a society that is stagnant <>
the narrowness of life and the barren landscape are excellent props for the directors vibrant themes shot without professional actors and done in a low key realistic style <>
the aims of this film are set too low to make it a masterpiece especially when you compare it to a satyajit ray film but this is still great cinema something american filmmakers would be wise to observe <>
abbas is not afraid to let his camera do the work to allow it to follow his student around in real time so we do get a feeling of what it is to participate in the journey <>
his relentless pursuit is poetically evocative depicting life in its raw elements <>
what more can you ask for <>

{-1} wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you <>
you can see its plot developing from a mile away <>
you are lured into its benign story of a single yearold girl looking for a soul mate in boston as that city is depicted as a miniwonderland for singles <>
this is a star oriented film and the star who carries the film is erin hope davis <>
that this is a dating film about singles who for reasons of fate or luck or whatnot have not had a successful match and are now putting most of their energy into fulfilling their careers is nothing new this type of film has been done often and better many times in contemporary films <>
the fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively and with more of a sense of urgency than this film <>
the main quirk in the plot here is that hopes pushy mother hollan visits her in boston sees her daughters livein relationship with a radical protester hoffman breakup and decides to put a personal ad in the newspaper for her harvard medical school dropout daughter who works as a nurse <>
this is done without her knowledge <>
it is cornball sitcom stuff but at least it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director <>
{-1} it is easy to like erin she is bright caring and attractively blonde <>
it is equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact with the financially strapped ruggedly handsome intelligent yearold alan alan who no longer wants to work with his father as a plumber but is doing volunteer work at the aquarium and attending college to be a marine biologist <>
of course he comes across as being so good though he does kill some fish in the aquarium that it is hard to believe hes for real or just some cardboard shining knight put into the story to give it an ideal to shoot for <>
the contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as the subway at a restaurant or on the phone <>
{-1} alans brother answers erins ad with a few of his pals as they each try to respond to her ad in a phony way making a bet that the first who gets to tongue kiss her that the others witness will win the bet <>
this subplot was as obnoxious to see take place as it is to hear told <>
{-1} that we have to see erin go through several dates to prove the point how ego sick these guys are each one more annoying than the other culminating in the most obnoxious one of all that brazilian lover jose who is about as charming as a snakeoil salesman who is actually the one she nearly flies away with for a holiday in brazil was not only incredulous but downright contrary to the rich presentation of her character that was the heart of the story <>
{0} anyway as expected alls well that ends well for this watchable piece of fluff that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its storyline <>
the dialogue was actually not bad those dating erin or trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they would actually say in their situation <>
and oh by the way wonderland refers to the stop on the boston metro it is where greyhound racing takes place <>

{1} writerdirectoracting starartist takashi kitano has broken ground from traditional films taking risks that defy explaining how to classify this very violent and tender film that sways between the two extremes and as the critic joel hoberman so astutely states fireworks is a cross between ozus late spring and don siegels dirty harry <>
{1} kitano is not noted for plot development and for understanding women <>
his forte is in the raw nerve of his films and the stark beauty of the cinematography <>
one should expect the unexpected from his films <>
the violence is brutal and fastpaced <>
for his effort he has won the grand prize at venice the first time a japanese film has done this since rashomon <>
{0} nishi kitano as a detective is part of a gangster stakeout with his partner horibe osugi and two younger detectives <>
but horibe tells nishi to visit his hospitalized leukemiastricken wife miyuki kishimoto and dismisses the other two policemen <>
this turns out to be a bad move and horibe is paralyzed by the gangsters <>
the narrative is told in flashbacks so any part of nishis life could pop up on the screen and what would seem like a commonplace crime story unfolding deceptively turns out to be much more than that even as nishi gets revenge on the yakumas who did this to his friend unafraid of bringing untold graphic violence to the screen <>
for one of the punk gangsters he sticks a pencil in his eye <>
you better believe that caught my attention <>
but if that was all this film was about the dirty harry description of the film would have been completely apropos <>
{0} feeling responsible for horibe and grieving for his wife the film turns into a road movie as he escorts his wife to the sights she wants to see for the last time leaving him to wonder why she would choose to see snow before dying <>
he shows great tenderness toward his friend horibe and in his taciturn manner he is not a man who likes conversation he sends him art materials so he can somehow keep his mind occupied during the suicidal period he is going through and we see some magnificent surreal and colorful drawings as a result which are the actual drawings of kitano <>
in between these grand gestures he violently confronts the gangsters responsible for his friends condition <>
{1} this highly original film that is at times a masterpiece and other times a grade b movie is difficult for me to penetrate what it all means as far as a commentary on japanese culture but the japanese critics have been critical of his attacks on japanese conformity while the japanese public accepts him as a popular performer and stage comedian even if his films have not been as well received in japan as they have been in foreign countries <>
as far as i am concerned i prefer ozu i am more taken with his intellect and perspective but i can appreciate the artistic direction kitano is taking his violent subject matter to as i found this volatile film to be something special but something i cant completely comprehend because i dont really know what he is trying to say as if that really matters <>
yet his film is a visual treat to behold and for that i am grateful and accepting of his work <>

{0} we have to wait until the near end of this love triangle a bleak drama about lowlife angst to hear the words of the cole porter tune of which this film takes its title from spoken by eddie sean to joey travolta she doesnt love you she doesnt love me shes delovely <>
but even these words dont make sense as we find out soon afterwards that their wife definetly loves one of them more than the other <>
maureen robin is the exwife of eddie and the current wife of joey <>
she is also the reallife wife of sean <>
{0} maureen and eddie are a couple who love each other madly but have many problems such as booze drugs and eddies habit of disappearing from timetotime <>
during one of these disappearing acts the pregnant maureen is savagely beaten up and probably raped by her neighbor kiefer gandolfini but when eddie returns she is afraid to tell him this fearing he will kill the neighbor <>
so when she lies to him and tells him the marks on her face are from a fall he doesnt believe her and goes into a rage forcing her to call ems <>
but this backfires and eddie shoots one of the attendants as a result he is sent away to the mental house for years <>
when he gets out his wife who never visited him while he was institutionalized has divorced him and remarried a successful construction company owner joey who raises the yearold she had with eddie plus raising their own two daughters <>
but she now must choose which is the one she really loves and wants to stay with <>
{-1} the film wants to look like a hip independent movie even though this john cassavetess scripted work he died in directed by his son is a hollywood produced movie <>
it ends up looking not quite like a john cassavetes independent film should look <>
it seems to be written as if someone thought that it would be cute to keep leaving out key parts to the story <>
as a result the film suffers from incohesiveness but because of the caliber of actors involved they make a cassavetes sandwich seem like it is a cassavetes sandwich even if there is not much real cassavetes in the sandwich <>
in other words the story just wasnt there it didnt seem to be original and this from a script by the real mccoy of indie films is astonishing to say the least even the ending of the film feels like a blatant rip off of the graduate <>
{-1} the film however managed to be entertaining <>
it just mostly lacked insight into what these characters were about <>
nothing was resolved or could be fully understood <>
for example it made no sense to think that eddie was well enough to be let free from the institution and still didnt know that he was there for a decade not for three months <>
too many other things about the movie were either murky or didnt add up unless you are willing to except anything goes as a satisfactory story line when it comes to dealing with those who are unstable <>
{1} what worked for me was the comic reactions by both stanton and travolta it broke the heavy barrage of emoting from the penns <>
i also thought that gandolfini did an excellent job in his brief appearance on screen <>
he held my attention with his mix of manic sadistic moves and cruel humor <>
without them this film would have taken itself too serious for the untasty cassavetes sandwich it was trying to serve its too willing captives in the audience <>

[17280/c]
{0} this bw film is based on the reallife criminal known affectionately by his cohorts as the general martin cahill brendan gleeson <>
it begins by him getting executed in front of his swanky house by a lone ira member <>
the film immediately flashes back to his squalid birthplace showing him as a kid played by the butcher boys eamonn owens as he was growing up to be a criminal sent to reform school and almost molested and then beaten by a priest <>
it seems it was in his blood to be bad <>
he grows up to despise anyone who isnt from his old neighborhood or part of his gang <>
priests are assigned the role of being pederasts which leaves cahill with a bitter opinion of religion and any authority figure for the rest of his life <>
the ira and the protestant loyalists are lumped together with all politicians as assholes <>
the police are simply pigs <>
voight plays the neighborhood cop who tried to befriend the youngster but was spurned by him <>
he is pictured as a straight but not too swift cop early on in voights career he is doing his sworn duty to kick the poor out of their homes and as his career is shown moving parallel to cahills we see how he rises up the bureacratic ladder of the police to become an inspector until he is thought of by cahill to be just as dirty as he is a sort of alterego <>
{0} cahill finds romance with frances kennedy and tina ball who happen to be sisters as he lives happily with both of them raising kids and supporting them with the loot he steals on his capers <>
he is a devilish little fatty certainly not looking the part of a big time hood as he loves to wear selfdeprecating t shirts with pigs and slogans on them he also makes a habit of trying to hide his face wherever he goes in public or when the police interrogate him <>
i guess these character quirks are supposed to make him somewhat appealing or show that he has some kind of psychological failings <>
{0} when we talk about cahill we are not talking about a robin hood even if thats what he fancies himself as as he steals from the rich only but that is only to line his own pockets and once in a while he helps out those from his old neighborhood <>
he does that mostly to gain favor with his people so that they dont rat him out <>
he is also shown as being brutal threatening court witnesses and finding loopholes in the law to get him off anyway he can no matter who he hurts <>
the film to its credit did not make him out to be a good guy <>
but the story is skewed in his favor making everyone else who opposes him look like suckers <>
{-1} i think if you look objectively at this rogue he is rotten to the core or as voight more appropriately says hes a scumbag <>
he shows no feelings when he learns that honest working stiffs are layed off their job when the jewelers he robs goes out of business because of the robbery <>
he shows no feelings robbing houses and living off what he steals <>
i wonder how many critics who raved about this film because of cahills winsome mannerisms would still like this character if he robbed them <>
and that is the point of this slickly done methodical film that makes it impossible for me to fall for the story i just dont care what happens to him <>
his life story bored me <>
i thought of him robbing houses in a miners helmet being a smooth cat burglar as merely clever filmmaking capturing what is sort of odd to watch as this fat guy bounces around and is so agile <>
it was great casting making gleeson the lead <>
but i still find nothing in his story that appeals to me about him <>
i was not impressed with his remorse after he nailed one of his gang members hands to a pool table after he thought that he was stealing from him <>
cahill is just a scumbag and voight was right <>
in fact the film could have been more interesting if it was about voight <>
i found him to be the more fascinating character in the story <>
sometimes just being ordinary hides so much more about a person and voight seemed to have heavy things on his mind that might have been more interesting than following this deadend obvious tale <>
{-1} the robberies he pulls off we have seen done countless times before on film <>
so all the precision planning that goes into robbing the museum of all its valuable paintings and the chase scenes via car or scooter were all well done but so what <>
this films theme has been done too many times for me to be carried away by such direction <>
i wanted something else from this film but i didnt get it <>
what i got was a masterful performance that i cant deny from gleeson and a director who can be magnificent in setting a playful confrontational tone with what he had to work with and letting the camera do its job <>
if i wasnt revolted by cahill as a criminal i would be inclined to rate this film much higher <>

[17300/c]
{0} how receptive you are to this welltold but unoriginal and very sentimental brazilian film about a miscreant old woman named dora fernanda a former teacher and now a letter writer in the central station of rio and a yearold orphaned boy josue vinicius whose mother has just been run over by a bus as she leaves the letter writer after writing a letter asking her drunken husband who abandoned her and the kid years ago to get back with them again depends on how much you mind being jerked around as if you were on a chain and could be pulled on it at any time <>
{1} though i gladly admit i enjoyed viewing the unusual road scenes in the desolate brazilian countryside where the people are poor ignorant superstitious and craving for a religion that gives them some form of hope for their dismal lives <>
this former documentary film director ably showed how religion can be as phony as the government that keeps most of the people impoverished <>
in any case this was a place where tourists dont visit and films about this kind of brazil are rarely seen by a foreign audience <>
{1} therefore for me the strongest point of the film is the documentary type of cinematography that went into the parched brazilian countryside making the barren land throb with life <>
the most exciting shots were reserved for the religious pilgrimage the two weary travelers stumbled into as they were caught in the light coming from the bright torches of the believers as the two wanderers search for themselves in the darkness of the night <>
that was pure cinematic magic <>
{0} ultimately this is a road film as dora relents from her hatred of the kid as she changes her mind after selling the kid to some unscrupulous people who will sell him for adoption <>
an adoption that could lead to unimaginable medical experiments done on the child <>
she decides to risk her life to get him out of those unscrupulous hands and take him to the father who may not even be where the kid thinks he lives <>
a theme that has been done before sometimes much better as in landscape in the mist <>
{0} the film emphasized the builtin misery the heroine has that made life for her to be a grind but there seemed to be something special about her that the actress was able to bring out from her characterization that made her seem better than what she appeared to be <>
the only friend she had for company was her unmarried friend irene pera a much kinder and happier person than she who could have been a prostitute the film did not make that clear it only hinted at that <>
{0} the beauty of this tale is not in the story itself if there is a beauty in the tale but in the way it affected the two main characters dora and josue as they eventually find something in themselves that they didnt know they had and they learn how to deal with the bitternesss in their life <>
their experience was comparable to a religious awakening <>
these two rotten apples turn out to be not so bad after all <>
how much you like the film depends on how believable you find the transformation that is about to take place for these characters <>
{-1} for me it was too much sentimentality and an uninspiring and contrived plot that kept me from warming up to the story <>
that the woman being transformed from a spiteful person who made fun of the letter writers and despised children will become transfixed from an ugly duckling mad at the world to an almost angelic figure someone capable of bringing great joy to the world was too much for me to accept all at once <>
the story turned out just too goodygoody for my taste <>
i do not trust films that are so contrived there is something about them that remains phony that good acting can only mask just so much of that phoniness <>
and the acting by montenegro was grand she is the film along with the fine cinematography but even that is not enough to completely overcome such a stale story <>

[17303/b-]
{1} this film doesnt claim to capture the accuracy of its shakespeare production it even relishes in the inaccuracies it presents ex there were no virginia tobacco plantations during that time frame there was no virginia but the film exuberates in the fun filled spirit and the frolicking nature of the performers and the backbiting that goes on backstage as it might have been in a production of a shakespearian play <>
the theme of the film is picked up from the literati speculations that a mysterious woman became the living muse who inspired shakespeares romeo and juliet <>
here she is admirably played by paltrow whose impeccable english and regal stature makes her a most endearing viola for shakespeare fiennes to fall madly in love with <>
{1} i had no problem adopting myself to the cleverness of tom stoppards screenplay though i am usually turned off by films that think they can get by on that one note <>
but this film was witty and except for a penchant to become at times a cliched formula plot type of film borrowed from thousands of other films you know the old underdog against the world story with the underdog winning the big event in the film in this case poor will shakespeare against the establishment that part of the film took away the fresh and innovative dash the film seemed to have on its own terms <>
{1} but i was nevertheless impressed by the carefree spirit of this romantic comedy it seemed to encapsulate a feeling for those times when a great poet had to be popular in order to be recognized as great <>
in school we are usually forced into believing shakespeare is only for the high brows not realizing that shakespeares plays were popular and written and spoken so that the common man could understand them <>
that shakespeare was a great bard there is no argument <>
but that he was at times too worldly is fair criticism <>
this film is very clear about that as a fictionionalized version of shakespeare or not <>
{0} his rivalry with christopher marlowe rupert as to who is the better playwright of the time was amusingly done showing the vanity and grace of both rivals <>
i was not taken as much with fiennes fiery performance as acceptable as it is as much as i was with the rest of the cast and especially paltrows very appealing performance <>
fiennes shakespeare seemed a little too flighty for my taste i just dont think will was like that and despite this fictonalized account of will it still bothered me to see him look so lost at times <>
the only performer who seemed to be in the wrong film was ben afflecks ned alleyn <>
you should talk shakesperian english if you are in a shakesperian production <>
{1} henslowe rush seemed to have some of the best lines in the film playing the shifty producer willing to try anything to stay in show business <>
when asked who is that addressing the actors by the plays financier hugh fennyman wilkinson who will soon comically become stage struck he says thats no one important thats the author <>
judi dench queen elizabeth played the queen with authority mopping up the screen when she was on with her commanding presence and sharp tongue going at full steam <>
{1} i found it to be an enjoyable film full of life and tongueincheek humor to sustain its colorful story within a story of the needy will on the advice of a therapist told to seek some romance to regain his writing ability <>
will thusly goes about with the staging of his play and is faced with the political and financial problems that always seem to plague theater people and with his own hapless love for viola which is complicated by her high birth and his low birth and that she is promised by her father to the coldhearted lord wessex firth who is a nasty character adding additional spice to the story <>
this all added to the splendid feel the director gave to this period piece that rises a little above a typical work of this nature as the parts of the film that were fictionalized were intriguingly and cleverly done for the most part <>
what was a lull in the film was when its story got too clever for itself and resorted to too much ado over nothing <>
{1} but after all there is something mysterious about show business that draws us into its bosom and allows miracles to happen for this notsoserious look at shakespeare to be dazzling and refreshing something shakespeare might have looked at with wonder speculating at who this shakespeare is he is seeing on film <>

[17341/a]
{1} truly independent filmmaker jost has completed his socalled trilogy about rural america with this film and has since moved on to self imposed exile by going to europe <>
this extraordinary film offers a long hard look at its subject matter as the camera is held steadfast not moving for insatiably long periods of time picking up all the appropriate nuances it needs to with deliberate dispassion as it looks at an oregon lumber mill whose owner tom blair is faced with unsettling economic news about the business he has builtup and worked at for his odd years of life <>
it focuses on this man and tries to find out who he is using him as a metaphoric symbol for america perhaps emulating emersons views as his writings are flashed on screen exhibiting some sayings from his essays on nature and america <>
{0} by seeing who this man is we get to see how he adjusts to his carefully scripted life the flyfishing he loves to do for the sport of it his easy and almost gentile manners and his very definite american persona as he is forced out of economic necessity to deal with the japanese businessmen he inherently despises and we get a picture of a rather complicated individual who has difficulty in communicating with himself and others so the closer we get to him the more we sense that there are a lot of things about him that remain unanswered <>
the shocker about his life that is about to unfold comes after he meets a foreign stranger on the street raving about the day of atonement coming soon and how god knows all that he should pray with him but is told by him that he has no time for that as he feels uncomfortable being around this religious zealot so he fumbles around with his wad of bills and thrusts a few dollars in the preachers pockets that are not kindly received by the preacher as he quickly departs from the preachers shouts that he doesnt want his money <>
{0} our perceptions of him as a rock of gibraltor type is squelched for good as we see him come unglued in his very comfortable home as he interacts with his wife ellen mclaughlin his second wife as she confronts him with a letter from her collegeaged daughter tracy who is his daughter via his first marriage and therefore not ellens real daughter <>
ellen insists on reading a letter addressed to her from tracy out loud accusing him of placing his hands on her private places as he responds to his wifes question all she wants to know is it true <>
and all he can respond is that he wonders why tracy is doing this to him saying that she is probably mixed up <>
what results is apocalyptic as the film becomes disturbingly mysterious and evasive never settling for sure who is telling the truth but destroying the family as it is <>
this scene could also be deemed as an attack on americas soul exposing it to questions about truth and character principles that are put under the microscope as the story builds to its very tragic outcome <>
{2} this is one of josts deepest and most penetrating films it could even be argued that he has made a classical film as it forcefully and subtly tells an american story replete with unanswered questions about family life that are haunting that give the film a certain power that makes you think for a long time afterwards what is it about this country that is so raw and violent in nature that becomes a part of the peoples own nature <>
{2} one of the scenes that i found most memorable was when the camera panned the diner where tom was dining with some coworkers and all we could hear at first was the muffled conversations of the patrons as the camera meticulously panned the diner until the atmosphere of the place was fully absorbed and we returned to tom and his conversation which became clearer as this scene played out a daily experience most americans have had but has rarely been captured so exactly on film <>
this time consuming shot is not attempted by commercial filmmakers who live in fear of losing their audience in a long nonaction shot <>
this is one of josts strong points his willingness to explore territory others fear to go <>
{2} josts film can be justifiably criticized for a few lapses in the story line it didnt clarify more precisely but more importantly it should be praised for the poetry it brings to its story when telling about a malaise in the american culture that is difficult to come to grips with as the american landscape is perceived as so beautiful a sight to behold and the country as so wealthy a place when compared with the rest of the world as it asks <>
but what does this mean if americans are not a happy people <>

{0} the film opens with popaul yanne a veteran of years army service recently returned to his birthplace perigord region to be the towns butcher taking over his fathers butcher store upon his death as we see him joyously cutting some slices of meat for the wedding celebration of the teacher leon hamel mario beccara whos marriage is being celebrated in this small oldfashioned french village as the butcher sits next to the smiling young and attractive headmistress of leons school helene st ephane audran <>
{0} popaul comes a courting helene making her an offer she cant resist he will personally choose the meat she gets promising her the best cuts available <>
why popaul is not married can be explained by his army service taking him to remote spots on the globe <>
he did not like the service saying he saw many terrible things there so many dead people as a result of war even though he was only a butcher there it had an awful affect on him <>
{0} helene comes from the city she said she came here to get away from everybody the reason is that she loved someone years ago who abruptly left her leaving her psychologically scarred and very hurt <>
she found it very easy and gratifying to give all her love to the children <>
the townspeople consider her to be an excellent teacher and so she lives happily alone <>
{0} soon a murdered old woman is found in the woods who was not raped <>
this does not disturb our butcher who comes by the school offering helene a leg of lamb as if it were a bouquet <>
helene whose whole life is focused around the school lives upstairs from the schoolroom she teaches in <>
popaul is respectful of her as she chooses to remain friendly but aloof from him as this strange relationship is bound by a certain chemistry they might have for each other even though they are very different in temperament <>
{1} the most memorable scene in the film is when the children are on an outing in the woods and one of the girls is about to bite into her roll when a red spot appears on it looking like jam <>
it turns out to be blood dripping down from a body on the cliff above them <>
when helene goes to examine the body she discovers its her colleagues new bride <>
she also picks up a cigarette lighter that she gave to the butcher as a birthday present <>
it is puzzling that she doesnt tell this to the police detective who questions her <>
that she doesnt say anything but continues seeing popaul strikes me as odd <>
but this is what adds to the flavor of this methodically simple story <>
the flawed characters are what elevate this film into something other than a straight mystery story because getting the murderer is not the theme of the film as much as trying to understand something that is complex about human nature <>
{0} by now we are familiar with life in the village we have seen the statue of the soldier in the village square by the schoolhouse everytime someone visits the school it is as if he was guarding the sacredness of this school and is a symbol of how society ruins its young men with untold wars <>
{0} it is hard to figure what is happening internally in the budding relationship between popaul and helene but it is definetly not a sexual one <>
perhaps it could be explained from her vantage point that she is curious about him and welcomes his occasional company but does not want to get emotionally attached to him <>
{1} when he comes over to paint her house he notices the lighter and retrieves it <>
all thats left for chabrol to wrap up the film is for him to have the butcher come face to face with the mistress he loves and for us to see if redemption through love is possible <>
it seems that he has been exposed for the first time in his life to someone he can love but since this respectful kind of love has not fulfilled him it has instead released demons inside him <>
of course it not clear who to blame for such horrendous crimes whether it is a father he hated or society or just something inside him that snapped <>
that was pretty much the theme chabrol used in his first film shot years before this one le beau serge which also took place in a rural village <>
but this time the theme is more fully developed by a director who has greatly matured <>
{2} this is chabrol at his best equal to hitchcock <>
spinning an eerie psychological thriller whose likable characters and the nostalgic village they live in are painted with a masters elegant brushstrokes <>
it seems films such as this one never get dated <>
i saw it when it first came out i saw it again on video in the early s and i just recently saw it again in <>
it gets better every time i see it <>
this time i was better able to notice the serene landscape in the background the magnificent limestone caves and the casual manner village life went on giving this film a very natural atmosphere <>
as a result this is a very satisfying film <>

{-1} elmore leonard novels have become staples for the movies in recent times they become movies easily translated into money making glossy thrillers noted for their amusing dialogue and smartly made stories <>
this film is no exception <>
it is entertainment for those who like fun pictures placing no other demands on the filmmaker <>
{1} clooney and lopez work well together there is a chemistry between them on screen that belies the unbelievability of the story they are in <>
clooney is jack foley antihero hero nonviolent bank robber robbed banks with just a smile a real smoothy but he gets caught robbing a bank and is sent to jail in florida but escapes <>
jennifer lopez is karen sisco federal marshal who happens to witness the jail break and is taken hostage by jack and his buddy buddy ving who is driving the getaway car <>
they throw her into the trunk of the car and jack joins her striking up a friendly conversation while gently caressing her thigh in the tight quarters they are in <>
the magical attraction between these two is very cleverly highlighted in this scene <>
{0} jack and buddy are off to detroit to score a diamond robbery something jack got wind of behind bars as a crooked weasely wall streeter richard ripley albert brooks blabbed to another prisoner that he has million in uncut diamonds stashed away in his house <>
the only thing keeping jack from being in wintry detroit and going through with the heist is that he wants to romance karen <>
she is intent on arresting him and moving up the ladder in the f b i chain of command <>
but to complicate matters she is also taken with his good looks and charm <>
{2} the cast is fine <>
steve zahn plays glenn and is as funny as hell as a drugged out thief <>
don cheadle is vicious as snoopy miller excon and detestable prisonmate of jacks <>
dennis farina is pleasantly sardonic as karens dad and confidante <>
{1} the film is violent it is sexy it has romance and comedy in it in fact it has just about everything in it except real intelligence but then again what results is a quickpaced actioner that is easy to watch and easy for the viewer to let his hair down a bit and be less critical for this film is a wellconceived star vehicle that works on all cylinders of the entertainment scale <>

{0} dark city is a sci finoir thriller that portends to deliver a message relating to the powers of the mind and the meaning of identity <>
everything attempted here has been done before but that still doesnt take away from the films feeling of looking like it is an original <>
credit must go to the creative use of special effects and the outstanding set designs used for its bedimmed city <>
{0} the film opens with the protagonist sewell waking up in a tub in a hotel room with a murdered prostitute <>
he is suspected of being the serial killer who is plaguing the city <>
and since he is not sure if he did it or not he has a dazed look on his puss like he will have throughout the entire film <>
just then he receives a call from sutherland who displays the crazed mannerisms of a nazi type of a doctor those more concerned about their inhuman experiments than the treatment of their patients <>
sewell is warned to get out of there immediately and sure enough there are strange creatures who are called strangers coming after him <>
the police are also in pursuit they suspect sewell of being the serial killer they are looking for <>
hurt is the deadpan hard nosed type of movie cop you would see in a s noir film leading the investigation <>
{0} the strangers we are told in the voice over that begins the film are humanlike aliens from another planet who have altered the memories of everyone in this city and have changed everyones identity so that no one really knows who is who <>
they just assume the identity that is secretly given to them <>
the strangers have forced sutherland who is not a stranger into working for them to inject a serum into those whose identities are being changed <>
the city remains dark at all times and at midnight everyone becomes unconscious <>
somehow sewell slipped through the cracks of the strangers and even though he has no idea of who he is he knows he cant be a murderer <>
he will become from now on the source of our information about what the strangers are all about <>
he will be on the run for the remainder of the film innocent though he may be just like a protagonist in earlier noir films questioning authority and trying to pull himself together unsure of whom to trust <>
his visit to the automat brought back pleasant memories of my childhood in nyc but this automat was cheerless and cold only its bright lights served as a sharp contrast to the dark eeriness of this city <>
{0} sewell fingers a postcard with a serene picture of shell beach on it that he has found in his pocket <>
shell beach seems important to him but he doesnt know why <>
he sees it advertised on billboards all over town but when he asks directions to go there no one can tell him how to get there <>
through sewells interminable questioning of everything he begins to unravel what is going on <>
he finds out that the strangers have telekinetic powers enabling them to put people to sleep by focusing on them they can also fly and go through walls and do mind control tricks <>
he also finds out that they came to earth because they were slowly dying out they have no individuality they only live unconsciously <>
what they want to find on earth is how humans live as individuals what makes them think and what is a soul <>
they came to do experiments on humans using them as if they were guinea pigs <>
sewell was made to be a murderer and studied to see how a murderer acts before he got away from their clutches <>
{0} sewell has trouble decifering what is real <>
he questions his wife jennifer whom he does not even know and she tells him that she had an affair with someone else <>
he falls in love with her anyway and the message of the film becomes only too clear it is in the heart that the individual is born and the heart cant be dissected and experimented with like a science blinded by technology and ignorant of the imagination <>
{0} proyas has created a visually challenging movie that is backed up by some thoughtful ideas <>
it is the kind of film that ufoers and alien watchers will tell ya see i told you there was life out there in space <>
but to others this is still only pedestrian stuff it is not the real deal <>
and the flat acting did not add anything positive to the story <>
i enjoyed the film for its ambience and for the creative mood it set <>
but what diminished its positives was how the main purpose of the actors seemed to be to spout robotic messages for the characters they were portraying <>
i wished that proyas had enough confidence to allow his visions to do the talking <>

{1} pi is an earnestly written and directed lowbudget black white shot scifi film that is made for intellectuals but shows them in a depressing light <>
it is about a mathematically gifted intellectual gullette and his obsession as a computer freak with predicting the exact performance of every stock and later on when he meets an hasidic numerologist shenkman he is intrigued to find out if a string of digits is the mystery number that will reveal gods true name <>
this curious story also concerns the price he must pay for his relentless pursuit of knowledge he shuns people and lives stoically and suffers from poor mental and physical health <>
his severe anxiety attacks bring on frightening illusionary visions that require him to ply himself with an assortment of drugs <>
the attacks he gets on the nyc subway are particularly horrifying such as being followed and seeing a brain on the subway platform <>
{0} pi is the mathematical symbol for the ratio of the circumference of a circle <>
its number has served the public well for generations <>
but our hero is rebellious of this symbols status quo in society <>
for him the mystery of numbers are the most important thing in his life more important than being happy <>
gullettes life is wrapped around three principles math is the language of nature all things can be understood through numbers and there are patterns in nature <>
{0} gullettes life comes apart when evil wall streeter brokers wish to use his knowledge for their profit and hasidim wish to use his knowledge to access god <>
he terms himself a jew who doesnt believe in religion <>
he considers his search as pure science and has no interest in making a profit off his knowledge or in knowing god <>
but his pursuit of knowledge misses a fundamental point his mentor and former professor at columbia margolis share a mutual interest in such data derived from numbers <>
they play go and discuss the problems they run into in their work after gullettes computer crashes and he loses his valuable data on the numbers he is working on the professor tries unsuccessfully to warn him of the dangers of getting too absorbed in his work so much so that he reaches a point where he cant see the obvious <>
margolis futilely shouts out that he should go home and relax and take a bath that he thinks too much he should learn how to act more intuitively <>
{-1} the flaw in this intellectualual characterization of gullette is that the director chooses to end gullettes vision and search by saying it is not so bad that he took out a piece of his brain because of all the problems he was having now he can experience the ordinary things of life <>
aronofsky did not take a stand to point out what he clearly meant by that that is unless he believes it is better to be selfsatisfied and rational than someone who goes all the way in his pursuit of genius <>
what is clear is that aronofsky blames science just as much as he does capitalism and religion for the way the world is in turmoil <>
{-1} this is aronofskys first feature something he won best director for at the sundance film festival <>
it is good to see that a film that is so cerebral and difficult to make can so popularly be received by selected audiences and most critics <>
but this being said the films popularity still scares me i think it is popular for the wrong reason <>
this film in retrospect might be viewed as an antiintellectual film since it emphasizes that gullette is more appealing when he is not completely absorbed in his intellectual pursuit <>
just as the films merits are easy to praise the films flaws are easy to find fault with <>
aronofsky has his protagonist retreating sophomorically into passivity in lieu of his quest this flaw should not be overlooked it so seriously challenges the films main character from establishing who he is and from our understanding of what is really being said about intellectuals <>
i think it should have been emphasized that it is irrelevant that the protagonist is an intellectual because he could be any personality type and that would not alter the fact that he was going through a nervous breakdown and in essence that is what has happened to gullette who is just marvelous in this very complex role in a film that gives off a rich aroma of intellectual pursuit but cannot digest the full intellectual and mystical meal it has cooked <>
