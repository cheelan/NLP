{-1} the yearold boris karloffs last completed feature film could have and should have been better as it suffers from a weaklycrafted script despite having great performances from the three prominent horror screen favorites who are in it that would be karloff as professor marshe christopher lee as morley and barbara steele as lavinia <>
though it is still worth seeing because of its star attractions and its innovative psychedelic offerings to the horror genre <>

but the professor replies in his noted serious karloff movie tone when the time comes your skepticism might be only a fragile shield <>

{0} david lynch eraserheadlost highwayblue velvetwild at hearttwin peaks switches filmmaking gears and goes from his hipster style of making weirdo films to making a simple heartrendering story of a yearold from laurens iowa alvin straight farnsworthhes actually who rides his ancient rehds lawnmower with a trailer hitched to it until that breaks down and he has to splurge for and get a john deere to take him the miles he needs to go which takes a little over five weeks to see his brother lyle stanton in mount zion wisconsin <>
{1} the film is most like a timeless spiritual quest something alvin feels he has to do in order to make peace with himself and with his brother <>
this is after a bitter argument which kept him from not seeing or hearing from him for the last years but now he learns that his brother has just suffered a stroke <>
{0} alvins mentally impaired daughter rose sissy lives with him after the state took away her four kids due to a fire in the house even though it was not her fault as alvin adds she got a raw deal from the state though there seems to be no bitterness in his tone <>
{0} alvins eyesight is so poor that he doesnt have a drivers license he walks with a cane has a bad hip has emphysema and is as stubborn as a mule therefore even though it doesnt make too much sense to travel the way he does no one can talk him out of it <>
he will not have his daughter drive him or take a bus or let a stranger he meets on the road take him there he feels that this is something he just has to do by himself <>
{2} the film reeks of midwestern wholesomeness folksiness and homespun philosophies <>
that it works so well is a testament to richard farnsworths compelling characterization and the flavor the film captures of the genuine straight people playing straight man to alvin straight on the twolane highway he takes across the mississippi river to wisconsin <>
it features a road show of ordinary folks consisting of those who can be kind to a stranger who is doing something he probably ought not be doing <>
their ordinary lives are put under the microscope in a slowmoving tale that is not in a hurry to get to the end of its journey as the strangers talk to each other seriously listen to each other and we as an audience get to know all of them reasonably well <>
as a change of pace american viewers might welcome a pause from all the action films and whacky stories they are inundated with and take a reality check to see if they are interested in seeing a film that most of them could have been in <>
{0} this is a fictionalized version of a true story that took place in septemberoctober of and was discovered by the screenwriters from an article in the n y times <>
{1} the film plays as if it was a foreign film since it is rare for an american film to be so selfconscious of itself so interested in just looking at the open blue sky the blowing wheatfields the bare streets of a sleepy town and having its star find peace with himself without any reason or big event in the film <>
it is also a film that knows how to keep proper time with its slowmoving story and the slowmoving transport of its hero <>
by doing this it suggests that his life can be carefully digested without everything being brought to a conclusion before it needs to be <>
{1} some of the vignettes worked better than others but what was always convincing was how the unsophisticated but straightforward manner of farnsworth came across in such an appealing way a way many americans would like to think of themselves as actually being <>
{0} his encounter with a runaway young pregnant hitchhiker whom he advises to go back home seemed too pat for it to be a moving experience as true as her sad story might be and as good as his advise to her was <>
yet lynch handled it correctly by just indicating by her changing facial expressions that something was clicking inside her and that she was becoming less confused about what to do and by having her symbolically show that she understood what alvin told her to do <>
his encounter with an hysterical lady who keeps hitting deer with her car on her way to work also seemed too overblown a situation to even comment on his failure to ease her anguish <>
fortunately nothing much is made of this event except alvin has the common sense to have some deer meat for his nightly camp fire <>
but when alvins tractor belt breaks going down a steep hill and he is shaken he is befriended by danny riordan cada a retired john deere employee who was at the time watching a practice fire exercise in this sleepy town <>
he looks upon alvin as the national treasure he is taking alvin back to his yard to camp out while he gets the towns mechanics bickering twins to repair the tractor as alvin has a go at getting the brothers to relate to each other in a more amiable manner <>
{0} the film moves into territory where people of good nature really communicate with each other and offer whatever support they can to each other and it is the right support because they have tapped into the source that gives them such character which is what the kindly relationship that developed between danny and alvin offered <>
alvin also meets an oldtimer he instantly relates to and since this is an odyssey where one of its primary purposes is of reliving the past and alvin throughout the journey is bringing up tidbits about his life what comes up now is the dark secret from his days fighting in ww something he couldnt tell anyone it is when he was a sniper and had the misfortune of unknowingly killing someone on his side and who better to tell this too than this ww veteran with such a kindly face who quietly understood everything alvin was saying knowing fullwell how farm boys came back from the war with images of the horrors they had been through and couldnt face themselves anymore and took to drinking <>
alvin has already faced his drinking problem and now that he has confessed to what has been eating away at him all these years he seems to be ready to fulfill his life by just seeing his brother again and making peace with him <>
{0} he will encounter a priest when he camps out on one of the oldest cemeteries in wisconsin and they will have a friendly discussion about religion indicating that theres not much difference between alvins baptist faith and the priests catholicism <>
his last meaningful encounter before he ends up on the porch of his brothers shack and is looking up at the night sky is with an oldtime bartender who serves him a miller light and gracefully talks the friendly chatter barkeeps throughout the country are known for <>
{1} this film was just right for what it wanted to do it felt good seeing alvins journey find closure <>
the sentimentality of the film was kept to the minimum and lynch did not try to make this small story grander than what it was and thats a good thing because the smallness of the story is what made this film seem so elegant and it is also what made it seem epic <>
{-2} but in a film that goes only surface deep in uncovering the mythos about smalltown america and its elderly it becomes unfortunate that the filmmaker couldnt delve deeper and get more out of the story as it seems as if this is a story waiting to be pried open even wider by someone who is not stuck on what seems to be the obvious but wants to make some waves with the politics of such smalltown conservatism and question why the towns look so dry and shrivelledup the people seem so unintellectual and the places visited so dull notwithstanding how kindly its citizens can act in an emergency <>
after initially being very pleased with the film i got to wondering what i learned about alvin straight that i didnt know when the film began and though i thought that alvins reflections about his life were genuine i still didnt really know what he is all about by the films end even if i now knew his darkest secret and that is what troubles me most about this film <>
{-1} there is something about his life that makes me think of alvin as not only a likable character which is what i found him to be but someone who is so setinhisways that he cannot evolve further and he is someone who is so accepting of the american way of life that it seems a shame that he cant find anything to say that questions the america and its institutions he was prepared to give his life for during ww <>
lynch seems to have created a character that buys into all the oldtraditional values america supposedly cherishes but without reexamining them such as family values religious institutions and the military <>
he would be someone who would make a good poster boy for the religious right <>
there seems to be no rebel in alvin as lynch seems to accept his status quo without any hesitation <>
{-2} alvin for all his appeal just seems to be another blind follower of the socalled american value system <>
it was difficult for me to see lynchs motivations for making this simple story without offering any ruffles in the feathers of the american eagle <>
though he certainly has a right to see things the way he does it nevertheless is disconcerting to see a film that is so accepting of the institutional american values without even questioning them <>
{-1} if this film was meant as a religious quest then it failed in that venture especially when compared to the lives of other religious figures autobiographies who had to fight the conformity of society and their own inner being until they were able through their journey to raise their consciousness <>
but if this is just a mild tale about an oldtimer doing something a little ornery then it works and is pleasant to look at just like it is pleasant to have a conversation on main street with some real people <>
it makes you feel good but is that challenging enough <>
{-1} i still dont know what lynchs motivation is for making this walt disney family value production film except it seems to be an ode to traditional values which seems odd coming from him especially since he is known rightly or wrongly for making films that are supposed to be onthecuttingedge <>
there was nothing daring about this film as its appeal is mostly through the magnificent performance of richard farnsworth who is a movic relic chiseled in dignity with his weatherbeaten face and his geezerlike sensibilities shining through <>
he is someone beyond acting criticism and whatever failings or misplaced points there are to his story the film is still a relatively interesting work retaining something about the american mythos that is worth investigating further this is a film that is wellcrafted and wellworth seeing and this is so because lynch knows how to film a story in a thoroughly professional manner <>
as for lynch personally i dont have the foggiest idea what his real beliefs are or what his changing career moves might mean but as far as this film goes he seems to be very accepting of the status quo <>

{1} i only know for sure that this is a revenge type of film and that it plays much like many a classical western but is shot in the s style of point blank and is scripted by lem dobbs most probably for the entertainment value it provides <>
i also know that a limey is a slang term for a brit and that he is played with a bravura performance by terence stamp <>
stamp is so good here with his fiery blue eyes intimidating tone and hollowed cheekbones jutting out from his intense face playing an excon who we only know as wilson and who is yearsold and just got out of the can in england after doing years for armed robbery <>
we see him on a plane from london to los angeles to find out how his daughter jenny melissa died while he was away not believing for one moment her death was a result of a car accident <>
{1} the story frequently goes from what he is thinking to some flashback to some future thing he wants to do therefore the time sequence is often confusing <>
but what remains riveting is the singleminded purpose he has as he tries to understand what happened to his daughter through his conversations with two of her friends the middleaged acting coach for his daughter elaine warren who tells him his daughter says she considered her father to be a ghost in her life and the burly heavily tattooed mexicanamerican eddie guzman who felt sorry for her and as an excon himself identified with wilson therefore he writes wilson in prison about her death <>
wilson also tries to find out what happened to his daughter through a trucking business that is gangster operated and the conversation with the surly men there takes a more violent turn resulting in the typical crime film rub out scene <>
the only thing of interest is that you have this elderly guy going after these younger hoods and you cant help feeling that when he kills them that they got what they deserved <>
{1} if there is supposed to be a deeper meaning than revenge in this very titillating feature it is hard to say what that deeper meaning is unless from all the garbled cockney sayings by wilson this is a film about what the meaning of ones life is as a senior citizen who had plenty of time by himself to give the question adequate thought as we see that he from timetotime reflects on that subject <>
{2} in any case this film seems to be all style and that style is wonderful to behold <>
it is also a film about nostalgia as it brings back haunting memories of a time that was intermixed with hope and confusion <>
the s are dismissed here as only being what happened in and early and that golden hippie age is further reduced to a few golden moments of feeling free through the promising new music arriving on the scene <>
at least this is the view of peter fonda who plays terry valentine a wealthy rock music promoter the supposed reason for wilson coming to america as he was jennys boyfriend when she died and is his prime suspect as her killer <>
fonda is the slick manipulator of the times who now has a few palatial homes and enough money to be thought of as a bigtime operator though there seems to be some trouble in his paradise as he is laundering dirty money for drug dealers and is constantly looking over his shoulder at what trouble lies ahead <>
he is very convincing as a slimeball and i liked peeking into his closet which is bigger than most peoples apartments with all those shoes and sweaters and i shouldnt forget that splendid pool and that panoramic view his ultramodern house has from the top of the los angeles hills indicating that he is someone who is doing very well <>
{-1} steven sodergergh sex lies and videotapekafkaschizopolisout of sight has a way of making quirky films that border on the mundane but offer promises of much more <>
in this film he engages several intriguing possibilities and plays them out to the hilt he has his two major stars fonda and stamp who were both born in and both played innocent antihero types in the s fonda as the biker drug dealer in easy rider and stamp in billy budd be pitted against each other <>
in addition stamp had a role in as a thief called wilson in the first feature by ken loach poor cow <>
these byplays to the film add some questions to what went wrong with the s as it seems to ask in the film how does wilson end up doing hard time in prison robbing the ticket office of a rock concert while valentine remains stuck in a time warp making big money by still packaging that same music still going after beautiful young girls this time replacing jenny with another livein beauty adhara amelia and crossing the line of innocence in drugs by becoming a party to the bigtime criminal aspect of the drug business as money is his lure and no other pretences of becoming a better person is given <>
the director makes frequent flashback cuts to the stamp of younger film days using the film he was in as it becomes more and more evident that this film has many purposes to it not excluding the former reallife film roles of its present iconic stars and how they are now portrayed onscreen <>
{0} as wilson and valentine square off with each other through wilsons bitter way of looking at him we get to view his take on valentines hollywood lifestyle as he visits him in his los angeles canyon home and meets his entourage full blast <>
the first one he meets is his shady lawyer adviser who is paid to protect him from the unseemly side to his business barry newman as the ish avery who plays his role as a villain with an intractable mindset <>
his first attempt to get wilson removed from the party results in his security man being fatally thrown down the canyon by the limey <>
there is also a colorful hitman that avery hires to get wilson stacy katt someone in love with his image of being a hitman who has the funniest joke in the film that is tasteless and irresistible what is the smartest thing to come out of a womans mouth <>
answer einsteins cock <>
{1} the filmgoer gets a lot for his price of admission here a great performance by the actors a pleasing revenge film with all the usual action sequences and a twist in the plot to keep the viewer further enthralled its a film that has all the techniques of the french new wave filming style with jump cuts and a fastmoving camera to keep the viewer guessing whats coming next as he is kept adequately confused so that he thinks he is missing something and should see the film again and the viewer also gets the promise that this baby has something wise to say which it appears to be on the verge of saying at times but i would say it is safer to believe that this film is style over substance and in this case that is not all that bad <>
perhaps the s itself was mostly an innocent call for a better world that was manipulated by those who knew better like the terry valentines of the world <>
therefore style over substance isnt all that bad a message for this intensely shot nouveaunoir work that seemed to be saying something like that or maybe its just that the kings english even when spoken by a common criminal in a rich cockney accent sounds so worthwhile that i have been so duly conditioned to believe that about the english language that i would listen keenly to anyone who spoke like that and believe i was listening to something philosophical <>

{0} much ado is made about aspidistra in this comedy adapted from the semiautobiographical novel of george orwell <>
its a hardy houseplant used in the story to connote middleclass london respectability when placed on the windowsill of a flat and in the lowclass lambeth neighborhood it is offered to the impoverished bookstore clerk as a sign of affection by his kindly landlady <>
the plant acts as a metaphor indicating that the confused young hero of the film cant escape his middleclass destiny <>
his landlady in his middleclass immaculate flat mrs meakin liz smith is actually the most diverting one in the film her nose lifts upward in snooty sarcasm capturing all you have to know about the direction this film is heading as she reacts to the poets one night drinking binge that got in the papers and got him fired from his hampstead bookstore job and kicked out of mrs meakins flat <>
the aspidistras in her place seem cold and hostile to the troubled young poet <>
they show how stuffy and pretentious life is in a suburban neighborhood while in a slum the people have nothing to lose so they are free to speak their mind and social restrictions are not as tensely kept <>
{0} the upperclass are royally seen through the depiction of ravelston wadham a wealthy publisher who has the luxury of having sex in the afternoon with his acidtongued priggish girlfriend vickerage and living a carefree existence in his spacious townhouse <>
he even considers himself to be a socialist which is ridiculed by his stodgy mannerisms and snobbish attitude <>
{-2} theres a point to be made in this s depression satire about money counting for everything and this point is hammered into every aspect of the story until it gets to be not only redundant but outright irritating to hear <>
the wouldbe poet gordon comstock grant who is unsatisfied with his success and promotion in an adverting firm where he is writing advertising slogans impulsively quits his job when he gets a good review in a london newspaper for one one of his poetry books published by his friend ravelston <>
he narcissistically dreams of international fame and entry into the poetry world of auden and t s eliot his girlfriend and coworker rosemary helena bonham carter does the graphic art for his slogans and is happy to be a petitioner of middleclass values which is what her boyfriend tells her he is rejecting <>
her role in the film is to wait for him to come to his senses and join her willingly in matrimony which he will do after he experiences the harshness of poverty tires of roaming the streets composing banal poems and accepts responsibility for making rosemary pregnant <>
his boss is erskine jim carter who makes money from gordons wordsmith skills therefore is disappointed that he quit but leaves the job open for him if he wishes to return <>
{-2} the story quickly makes its point as valid as it might be in orwells novel here it seems trivial that people delude themselves into thinking that they are the next shakespeare and spend a miserable time living in poverty or doing what they shouldnt be doing when they would be much happier being accepted into the middleclass where they duly belong <>
its a fair enough point made but the story has this nasty habit of being saccharine to a point where its sugary qualities could be fatal to the viewers heart <>
even the scenes of poverty are sugarcoated making everything look so awfully nice <>
the film shows how foolish the young man was in giving up his career work in which he shows an aptitude for and foolishly chooses something he was not born to do trying to be a william blake who was endowed with a rich poetical imagination therefore could live joyously in an indigent state in lambeth and still be creative <>
something gordon cant do <>
it also somehow stretches the point of art and advertisement having much in common cynically stating there is little difference between how they achieve their ends <>
{-1} it just became dull watching all the clich about the classes bantered back and forth with the picturesque view of gordon descending into poverty working in a musty lambeth bookstore and the creamy richness of his return to middleclass life when the film ends on a happy note as he returns to his former place of work to cheers from his colleagues and into the warm embraces of his girlfriend and back into the good graces of his stolid middleclass sister harriet and back to his eager boss who is only too glad to hire him again <>
{-2} the message i got as i watched this tepid middlebrow socalled art film is that living in poverty can be stifling and that kind of life is not what makes an artist <>
what the film had to offer was nothing more than seeing a few artists names referred to some inferences that there is a merry war going on between men and women some mild invectives about class differences and all of lifes battle were condensed to being about money matters <>
for a movie railing against accepting bourgeoisie values it instead becomes a movie that ends up glorifying those values <>
its final message is that there is no escape from ones destiny <>
{-2} if one looked hard enough there can be found some wit in gordons portrayal of a likable jerk with artistic ambitions and some charm in his relationship with rosemary <>
but this uninspired script cannot find anything relevant to say to make this satire meaningful <>
in fact it makes a mockery of orwells intentions to sympathize with an artist who is prepared to make his own way in the world <>
orwells down and out in paris and london offers a more interesting take he has on being poor as he worked for a time as a dishwasher and in a hampstead bookstore as a clerk <>
youll get a better feel of what orwell was trying to satirize reading that book than you will by seeing this film <>

{1} this is a silent serial told in chapters about subversive vampire thieves as they suck the blood out of sleeping bourgeois parisian society stealing their jewels in novel and innovative ways <>
the public loved these films until the talkie pictures came into being and this film was forgotten until rediscovered in the s by henri langlois and in the s by directors such as alain resnais and jacques rivette <>
{0} the vampires are led by the irrepressible irma vep musidora her name being an anagram for vampire <>
musidora was a former music hall star whose raven hair and seductive looks suited her villainous blackgarbed heroine role in contrast to the sugary sweet blond american heroines at the time who starred in popular serials such as the perils of pauline and the exploits of elaine <>
{2} the films were shot cheaply and swiftly in the gaumont studios and on the surrounding parisian streets <>
the combination of lyrical odd scenes of naturalism and the melodrama of a crimefiction story as the film is full of disappearances and disguises sudden deaths and uncanny resurrections hidden trapdoors and secret tunnels bus chases and rooftop escapes which gave the film its power its sense of dread perfectly matching the publics mood at the time of world war <>
and it was that coupled with their almost anarchistic view of society the vampires steal only from the rich and their often contemptuous disregard of logic the result of tight shooting schedules that made the films so popular <>
les vampires was treasured by surrealists like andre breton and louis aragon which gave it weight in intellectual circles also <>
{-1} the serial ran into some trouble with the parisian chief of police who had one of the films episodes banned for glamorizing the criminals <>
feuillade the former cavalryman and journalist atoned for his sin with more moralistic films in the future such as his judex <>
{2} les vampires is one of frances great classic contributions to the world of cinema and fortunately this once lost film has now been restored and is available on video <>

{-1} if you like nonsense musicals with plenty of singing beautiful set designs fantastic colors sex witchcraft and a fairy tale charm to it then you will probably like this film which is in many ways like flying down to rio <>
though i was hoping it could be more like those jacques demy or jacques rivette musicals exhibiting a little more substance <>
but if you are in a mood for some light entertainment this zany musical has plenty of oomph and should satisfy your latino appetite for something that is easy and sexy to look at <>
{0} the little known director of this film hails from venezuela which gives this french film a very natural latin twist to its story and music <>
the film opens in a venezuelan church where ana ariadna is about to get married at the altar but for some inexplicable reason changes her mind and runs out of the church grabs a taxi packs her maria callas poster and is on a plane for paris still in her wedding dress <>
in paris she rooms with four other countrywomen finds a job as a housekeeper and another one in a bakery store and decides to follow through on her dream of being a professional opera singer by taking lessons with a voice coach <>

{1} an accurate historic story of the revolt by africans on the slaveship amistad and their capture and trial in new haven connecticut <>
much of the story involves a courtroom drama featuring the slave cinque djimon who led the revolt <>
the relevance and devastating emotions of the slaves were intelligently presented even though at times the film was static and seemed to have no legs to get it going in the direction it wanted to be going <>
yet it still turned out to be a potent and forceful movie <>
{2} it is hard to be critical of the stand for morality and piety the film makes but what saved this picture from being the holier than thou selfrighteous bomb i thought it might have been were the presence of john quincy adams hopkins and cinque in the film <>
hopkins gave life to the story by his stunning status and ability to articulate <>
cinque represented the black man whose viewpoint was seen through his massive physical strength and pride <>
he gave authenticity to the events of the story <>
without their human emotions one by his words the other by his facial expressions the film would not have been as impactful as it was <>
there could be only so much that one can take from watching the misery of others until it would become overbearing and defeat all its good intentions <>
{1} the exploitation scenes of the slaves being captured by nets in their homeland and then chained on ships and some being thrown overboard to drown were truly malevolent acts and thankfully kept to a minimal portion of the films time <>
or else the film would have been a very difficult one to watch <>
{0} for the trial of the slaves the abolitionists hire a selfpromoting realestate lawyer roger baldwin matthew to take their case <>
he at first does not realize the importance of the case he is taking on thinking all he has to do is treat it as an ordinary case of a property dispute <>
but he soon realizes that this is a very important case <>
he presents this question in court were they born as slaves on a plantation say in the west indies or as free men in africa <>
if it were the later he would win freedom for his clients because free men are allowed to resist being taken by force according to the constitution <>
he eventually gets cinque to speak through an interpreter and tell the story of his african mende tribal people who were captured by rival tribesman and sold to an illegal portuguese slave ship and eventually put aboard another ship la amistad in havana cuba <>
he also tells of the part he played in the revolt and taking over of the ship and then being tricked by the two surviving portuguese seamen into taking them to america instead of africa <>
{2} spielberg is the master of a visual story and here he is in top form <>
the carnage and cruelty aboard the slave ship are shockingly and revealingly shot giving one enough of an idea what the slave had to endure <>
that gives the film the force and importance that is needed for it to make its moral point <>
the final moral point is made in front of the supreme court with john quincy adams saying if these men are not set free you might as well start the civil war now <>
he then proceeds to rip up a piece of paper to symbolize the death of the declaration of independence <>

{1} for a film that runs close to minutes is in bw and is short on storyline this bfilm does a nice job in getting a hugh cast to be part of this crime caper each getting into the act with a brief moment of quality movie time <>
{1} the suave star of the falcon series george sanders has grown tired of the role and wanted to move on to bigger and better things in hollywood so what better way to do it than to get his younger brother tom conway to become the next falcon private detective <>
this is smoothly arranged in the script by rko as sanders gets knocked unconscious for most of the film and tom shows us that he can play the falcon with the same deftness as his russian born brother can <>
when the surprise ending comes sanders gets himself killed off the series and graciously passes the role onto the future falcon who will appear in more of these lightweight crime stories <>
the reason tom has a different name is because george came first and hollywood decided that tom should be the one to change his family name <>
{1} the falcons brother is a routine espionage story that is crisply told in a manner that is formularised and executed to perfection <>
gay lawrence sanders goes to meet his brother tom conway coming in by boat from nassau whom he hasnt seen for years <>
when he arrives with his stoogelike cohort lefty barclay he is told that his brother committed suicide <>
but when he goes to identify the body he realizes that is not his brother but he doesnt tell that to inspector timothy donovan clark and instead follows an attractive woman diane melford andre who hurriedly leaves the boat <>
{0} the place she leads the falcon and lefty to is a womans fashion salon where the head designer is arlette wynters and her love interest is her underling paul harrington newill who is also having a relationship with the designer from the firm diane <>
but before you can catch your breath and take in the fashion show going on diane is shot and the falcon is suspected of killing her by the police for revenge of his brothers death since she was dating him on the boat trip and the falcon was spotted by the police following her after she left the boat <>
{0} the falcon goes on the run collecting evidence on the way he already has the poison cigar that killed the unidentified body aboard the boat proving that it wasnt a suicide <>
he runs into his brother in the alley and gets sideswiped by a car trying to kill him and this will incapacitate him for most of the film as tom without missing a beat takes over the case <>
{-1} theres not much to the plot its about nazi agents trying to assassinate some south american diplomats and tom hooking up with a fashion model reporter marcie brooks randolph who has ambitions to land a job as a crime reporter and to land the handsome future falcon <>
{0} everything in this film goes as expected the cops are gently razzed the villains are easy to detect the romance is easy to handle the story is easy on the noggin and if you are not looking for anything fancy here youll extract your ounce of entertainment value from it <>
if youve seen one falcon episode then you might as well have said youve seen them all <>
this one would rate as an average one <>
the best one that sanders did is probably the first of his five the falcon takes over <>
the reason they were so popular is because theyre so easy to watch and the stars exude a certain amount of charm making these little crime capers quite enjoyable <>

{1} this romantic comedy about the love life of comic book writers feels like a sitcom because that is what it basically is not withstanding that it pushes the envelope further out by having characters in it who are more sexually active than the usual sitcom <>
its story is also a bit more arresting <>
its strongest asset being the quickwitted and acidy dialogue it brings to the table by its capable cast who are most able to deliver those punch lines <>
{0} at a comic book fair in nyc comic book writers and longtime friends holden ben and banky jason are signing autographs for their hit comic bluntman and chronic <>
in this scene we get a good dose of the ambiance of the comic book world and we get a chance to see what their readers are like and of how serious the writers are about the work they do <>
we learn that they want to be looked upon as artists and not to be taken for intellectual lightweights just because they work in the comic book business <>
{0} a comic book writer alyssa joey is introduced to them by another comic book writer hooper dwight who poses as a black militant hiding from his comic book audience that he is gay <>
it turns out that holden falls for alyssa and he also thinks they have much in common since they both come from the same town in the new jersey suburbs but what he doesnt realize at first is that she is a lesbian who is unwilling to get into a relationship with a man <>
their first meeting over a game of darts gives holden what he calls a shared moment banky has a blast with this explanation <>
{1} the wouldbe lovers must take risks to make their relationship work <>
holden is the first to feel that he must be with alyssa <>
he has led a sheltered somewhat nerdy life till now still living in the jersey suburbs while alyssa is wild and alluring <>
she is very sexy having a deepthroaty voice and an open manner that makes it easy to talk to her <>
but having led a very active sexual life experimenting with all sorts of sexual encounters she comes with a checkered past <>
holden is able to face up to her lesbian affairs but has difficulty in reconciling her reckless sex with multiple male partners whom she does not even care about <>
and it disturbs him that he has to find this out through gossip and not from her especially when she seems to make such a big thing about honesty in a relationship <>
smith does an excellent job in showing the doubts men have about being with a loose woman who they are smitten with <>
our hero is not a liberated hero but it is his flaws that give him credibility <>
{1} the twist in this story comes about in the part his wiseguy partner plays in trying to destroy their relationship out of jealousy <>
the film gives this a surprising psychological meaning <>
the relationship between the three of them becomes an unsmooth one as they all battle the mundane worries most people have in regards to love affairs friendships and how it will affect them and their careers <>
{-1} chasing amy is a moral fable <>
the title of the film derives from the story the director himself tells to holden as he portrays a character called silent bob <>
he tells them a story about a girl named amy <>
she is the girl who ran away from him because he didnt know how to handle the situation he was in and he ended up losing the girl he loved <>
this scene was not needed as the story itself was simple enough to follow <>
we did not need a ready made explanation of the film from the director <>
{1} not everything worked or made sense but the characters and their problems seemed real <>
and the dialogue hit the mark more often than not <>
this is smiths third film about the travails of young people growing up in new jersey and influenced by pop culture <>
what i didnt like about the film is that despite its attempts not to be viewed as a sitcom that is what this film is even if its mature story line adds more weight to it <>
sitcoms are just not the way i like to see drama unfolding as it always leaves me thinking that things are still being dumbed down that even though these are characters we usually do not see on the screen and it is refreshing to see them we are nevertheless not going any deeper psychologically with this story and with character portrayal than other sitcoms go <>
{1} smiths film does give us a real sense of a relationship and the struggle it takes to make it work but there is still an air of superficiality about its presentation <>

[22522/a]
{2} a film that tries to bring back the fantasies and dreams of childhood for two young women in their twenties <>
it is an incomprehensible enjoyable uninhibited slapstick romp <>
as insignificant as the title of the film is to the story i am at least sure that celine and julie are seen at one moment towards the end of the film going boating at least i think i saw them <>
{0} celine is played by juliet berto she is a nightclub magician and julie the shy librarian is played by dominque labourier <>
this film is very loosely based on henry james a romance of certain old clothes <>
{2} the plot is basically about julie allowing celine to share her flat and the two of them acting in an impromptu manner they wrote their own dialogue as we see them sharing a boyfriend and partaking in their daily routines <>
but there are unusual complications to this already complicated story and in the subplot there are two actresses playing the same part bertoogier and dominquepiser <>
the four of them each take turns to visit every day a haunted house and watch the same events take place <>
what results is an hallucinatory fable that is funny scary idiosyncratic original lesbiancentered derivative of cartoons and musicals and truly indescribable <>
it is a true cinephiles delight and a challenge to the old linear way of looking at films <>
it is a film that should be seen more than once since it requires proper mood and spirit to enter its delightful summertime montmartre locale and the visions of its meditations and it takes some getting used to since this is a different type of cinema from the usual american fare <>
{2} this is a special movie that some might detest or feel put upon on first viewing it but is for others an exhilarating work an outstanding example of a noncommercial film allowed to take on the personalities of the stars without worry about it being a formula story or needing a glib ending <>
it is deserving of its wonderful reputation among cinephiles <>
{0} as my mother used to say when she gave me something to eat as a child that i wasnt familiar with and i made a face try it who knows you might like it <>

{1} the talented mr ripley offers another screen adaptation of the patricia highsmith novel the first being rene clements purple noon a more straight forward hitchcock type of film that the french actor alain delon couldnt do much with <>
then there was wim wenders better version the american friend where dennis hopper got into the sinister con mans character and showed how his criminal guilt was related to germanys postwar guilt <>
this time in a grander and more elaborate version tom ripley damon is a closet homosexual and someone capable of killing anyone who interferes with his plans to assume someone elses identity which makes the crime thriller take on a slightly different meaning from the way highsmith intended it to be perceived she also wrote the novel for the great hitchcock film strangers on a train <>
for her life had no escapes or false sentimentalities attached to it its just a trap that everyone is in and cant get out of exceptthey can try to make things better for themselves through their cunning ways <>
{-1} anthony minghella the english patient will make the theme of the film into an identity crises problem that ripley has and allow the film to become a character study about a sociopath who can complacently say about himself i always thought it would be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody <>
he has removed most of the complicated psychological layers of the character and made ripley into a seemingly nicer sort of person the murder he commits is not premeditated as in the novel but comes about when he is provoked beyond what his fragile nature can take <>
{0} ripley is first seen playing the piano in a borrowed princeton insignia blazer he got from the piano player he replaced at a rooftop reception and the ambitious nyc mens room attendant with the ivy league looks is spotted there by herbert greenleaf rebhorn the shipping magnate as he approaches ripley with the thought that he is a college classmate of his sons and comes from the same upperclass strata and he therefore makes a snap decision to have ripley go find his wandering playboy son in italy and urge him to come home <>
for his troubles he will be paid a thousand dollars and expenses <>
{1} minghella paints a picturesque view of how these rich americans in the late s live as ugly americans in europe as the photography is brilliant with its array of luminous colors from mediterranean places such as san remo palermo roma and venice <>
the beautiful scenery villas luxurious hotels and splendid boat rides are just right for getting the audience all excited about taking a look at how the smartset travel and spend their leisure time <>
this fits in nicely with the touristy look of the film <>
but the story as engrossing as it is can so easily be forgotten when the film ends <>
{-1} this is a big budget miramax film not an arthouse personal film <>
its magnificent look took away any kind of noir intent the novel might have had if the film was done in the pure form it was written in <>
{-2} the film becomes primarily a character study about ripley and not a film that is too concerned about filling all the holes it has in its plot which are enough to sink a ship <>
ripley is unsatisfied with his lot in life and takes this once in a lifetime chance to be with the elite <>
he manages to engage the manipulative and goodlooking dickie jude in the italian seaside town he is idling away his time in who seems to act more queer than ripley but apparently isnt as he is sexually active with his girlfriend marge gwyneth someone ripley tries to befriend <>
she just seems to be along for the ride her part is a rather inconsequential one though it is in the same vein as the tiresome parts she usually stars in but here we are at least spared from seeing tears come down her reddened cheeks <>
we just see her justifiable petulant anger as she gives ripley that knowing bitchy look of disapproval indicating i know what you did to my dickie <>
{1} ripleys main intent will be to concentrate on absorbing himself in dickies personality and to try to ingratiate himself with the womanizing and capricious wastrel a part that jude does a good job of conveying as he captures the characters nasty mood swings as well as his goofy flippant side <>
one of the ways ripley endears himself to dickie is sharing in his love for jazz with him even though he is only interested in the music because he knows that dickie is <>
this friendship built on his telling dickie the reason that his father sent him here will work out well as long as dickie finds him amusing but the relationship soon becomes frayed as dickie becomes irritated with some of his homoerotic gestures and grows tired of his lingering presence around him <>
{0} when asked by dickie what his one talent is ripley names three forger liar and impersonator <>
as the creepy young man will use his acquired talents to ingratiate himself to his superiors he is seen here as being less a scam artist than he is of being someone trying desperately to fit in where he doesnt belong <>
when he senses he cant be a hangeron with dickie or dickies crowd anymore he seizes the moment to kill dickie and take his identity as he discovers he has a talent for murder also <>
{0} having already maneuvered his way into dickies crowd but with no great lasting friendships in sight his two greatest successes being with the textile heiress meredith logue cate and the wealthy peter smithkingsley davenport <>
he met meredith aboard the ship to italy and told her that he is dickie greenleaf and managed to get her to think they are kindred spirits and to have her fall pathetically in love with him <>
she will turn up at odd moments in his travels and be portrayed as the spoiled rich girl who doesnt know what to do with herself <>
the trick in this relationship is for ripley to think quickly on his feet so that she will not know that he is an impostor <>
his other positive relationship will be a homosexual one as peter will know him as ripley and be used by him to cover his murderous tracks <>
{2} the strongest performance in the film comes from freddie miles philip seymour hoffman as an edgy playboy friend of dickies who smells out ripley but just fails to realize how deadly he can be <>
the scenes with freddie pushed the envelope wideopen and made the average intelligence that ripley possessed diminish in his chilling presence <>
hoffmans screen presence sparked keen interest in the story and made it seem more powerful when he was onscreen <>
when he wasnt onscreen the story wasnt quite as fascinating which made me wonder if he would have been even more suited to play ripley than the bland damon was <>
{0} as the story gets violently outofhand the pleasure in the film becomes mostly in watching the obvious lies ripley tells when confronted by someone who knows that he is not being straight with them and yet he is shown to still manage to think fast on his feet and come up with a fitting story to put them off his trail <>
and even if there seems to be little sympathy for the idlerich during ripleys spree there also becomes less and less sympathy for the psychopathic ripley who the filmmaker was insidiously trying to get the viewer to identify with <>
{-2} the only question remaining becomes not why ripley is doing this but whether or not he will get caught <>
thereby the film loses touch with the character who falls too far from the graces of any rationality for social acceptance who is seen drowning in his own lies and trapped in his own guiltridden nature <>
in the novel ripley is more of a longrange scheming sociopath than he is in the film <>
the new spontaneous twists in the film changes the mood of the story and makes it more creepy but not more endearing <>
i think the reason for that is because the matt damon part loses the characters rich rebellious flavor and makes him become less an antihero than viewed as a serial murderer <>
to fully identify with ripley would require the viewer losing himself totally in the character and seeing the world only through ripleys narcissistic eyes and that is the way minghella probably wanted one to see the film and understand how ripley operated <>
the problem with that is it simplified all the dark notions of ripleys character and lightened the burden of the story too much trying to make it conform with the s style of film <>
as a result this seductive film comes to a conclusion that failed to live up to the gamesmanship offered throughout most of the story <>
the film became less meaningful the longer it went on and it ran for minutes <>

[22534/a]
{2} sidney goldin codirected maurice schwartz uncle moses in this film from schwartzs stage adaptation of sholem aschs novel <>
it was one of the early yiddish talkies to date and one of the most prestigious <>
schwartz was celebrated as being the olivier of the yiddish stage <>
he is one of the worlds greatest actors he was tevye in fiddler on the roof but he is not as recognizable a name as he should be <>
this comedyromance that turns dramatic should give you a good idea of how great an actor he is <>
the film depicts the oldworld values as it clashes over the newworld dreams and it is played out by seeing the traditional jewish family undergo tremendous changes in their lifestyle as they must adapt to the ways of their new country <>
{0} the patriarchal uncle moses is the antihero rich clothing manufacturer and twisted namesake of his biblical counterpart <>
he left the east europe of kuzmin where he was a struggling butcher and where there was widespread poverty and persecution of the jews to come to america the promised land and start his tailor business in the crowded jewish ghetto on the lower east side of nyc <>
as crude and as vile a man as he is the benevolent despot brought his landsman from the shtetl jewish village to america and got them jobs and took care of them <>
their end of the bargain was that they worked in his sweatshop for hours a workday and they only received minimum wages as he did not allow them to belong to a union <>
for his end of the bargain he treated them as family paid for treating their illnesses acted as a benefactor for them and showed signs of generosity to them and those landsmen still back in kuzmin giving freely to charity <>
he was uncle moses and the workers accepted him as their patron and savior <>
{0} the first talking scene in the film indicates the complexity of the uncle moses character as a rabbi from his old shtetl visits his clothing factory to solicit a donation <>
moses is busy dealing with the two women he had affairs with the wife of a luncheonette owner and a polish shikse gentile <>
the scene belies his ability at manipulation as the tricky boss and the rabbi with his hands out go after what they both want from each other as the rabbi amuses the patriarch by chanting a yom kippur prayer that brings out the nostalgia in moses who doesnt let the rabbi forget for a moment who has the money and the power as he donates money to the synagagogue and to a cemetery in kuzmin <>
uncle moses enjoys his moses role that he plays to his people which teases his vanity and his sentimental side <>
though he is not a religious man he respects the traditions as the film makes many biblical allusions in telling its story <>
{0} his nephew sam gertler runs the factory <>
he is americanized preferring to speak in english and is disliked by the workers for being a nasty tyrant <>
he follows his widowed uncle around acting as his flunky <>
his hope is that his childless uncle doesnt marry and that he will inherit all his money <>
{0} moses father rubin goldberg plays the shakespearianlike fool who speaks the truth even if he appears as if he is crazy <>
he goes through the factory chanting a catchy melody and bitterly denouncing his son in a joking manner and denouncing the capitalistic system of his new country wishing to go back to the old country and be buried there <>
he compares his son to tsar nicholas and to the pharaoh <>
the father says that he is the real moses that he will lead the jewish workers in this sweltering sweatshop out of bondage and take them to the sea <>
{0} one of moses workers pokes fun at his huge belly and is fired <>
the cowardly worker schweid brings his yearold attractive daughter masha abarbanel to beg moses to give him his job back <>
when moses shows a romantic interest in the girl and is ready to do something for her father but his flunkies in the background encourage moses to make fun of her cowering father she lashes out at him calling him a beast a brute and a dog <>
moses likes the spirit she shows defending her father and gives him back his old job at the machine and with a raise <>
the much older moses will woo the reluctant masha for a year showering her family with gifts shaving his beard and going to the gym to lose weight for her sake <>
the parents will see this romance as an opportunity to better their lot in life and push their daughter to accept his marriage proposal not caring one bit that she doesnt love him <>
meanwhile charlie zvee the young marxist follower who lives in her tenement building whom she is in love with rails against her decision to marry the wealthy boss <>
he will get involved with the union and start organizing the workers <>
{0} the most memorable scene in the film is the attempt to have a traditional wedding ceremony as the wedding takes place in his inlaws fifthfloor walkup apartment where there is traditional song and dancing and a shot of the forlorn charlie watching the wedding from his apartment window that faces mashas <>
{0} on the day that masha gives birth to a son the union strikes his shop and moses is disappointed that his workers would go behind his back and do this to him telling them how much he did for them though he is still ready to sit down with them and work things out <>
but his inlaw insults charlie and the strike takes place as he turns his attention to his baby and lets sam handle the strike <>
sam breaks up the strike by using thugs something moses is repelled about and vows to never let something like that happen again <>
{0} but uncle moses way of life radically changes as his wife cant find satisfaction in the marriage even though she tells him that she likes him better than she does her parents <>
this all gets to moses who will have a heart attack over the strike <>
he also agrees to divorce masha <>
he loses interest in running all his businesses and decides to make out a will leaving a quarter of his estate to the workers <>
{0} the times have changed for the immigrant jews as they had to choose between two bad choicesthe false family of the transposed shetl or the emerging false family of the union <>
moses becomes a symbol of the past as he is relegated to a sentimental and irrelevant role in the future <>
the last shot in the movie is ultimately a sad one of him coming back to visit his family of workers as he requests one of them to sing a familiar nostalgic melody and he proceeds to tell them a story of what a man is how a man builds houses factories brings his countrymen to america and after all the grave awaits him <>
{0} the evils of american materialism is matched with a disdainful look at the oldworld economics and the old way of arranging marriages of the parents disregarding what their children want and acting as benovolent tyrants over them <>
america is now a place for inspiration for the younger generation yiddish will not be their firsttongue and the rich opportunities in the new land will take precedence over everything else <>
masha will be viewed as a victim caught in the changing times who did not marry for money herself but only to please her parents an obligation she believed that she had to fulfill <>
moses will be looked upon with mixed emotions with some fond memories of him for his charitable nature and some disappointments that he was an exploiter <>
he will be viewed as a representative from a time when the immigrants were in a transitional state in their new country when they lived in poverty and strived to have their children gain the fruits of the american dream <>

[22535/b]
{2} this is a mans film for the kind of a man who is lost in his sense of being a man and lost in the nostalgia of the s drug scene <>
the women all have minor parts and are viewed as sex objects or conniving harlots <>
its the s and were in layed back l a and theres a character called lebowski bridges who likes to be called the dude <>
his two other bowling pals walter goodman and donny buscemi like him are dysfunctional <>
the plot unfolds into a series of mistaken identity scenes and overthetop comedy by mistaking the dude for another lebowski a wealthy cripple the story takes on the weird humor of the coen brothers as they build a case for this likable california bum to get satisfaction over his pride being hurt <>
he plays out a very funny fantasy role spoofing the raymond chandler private detective type of stories in the hollywood of the s <>
{1} you see the story is about intruders who piss the dude off when they piss on his rug <>
so he goes to the rich lebowski david huddleston and asks payment for his rugs damage using the logic that it is this guys fault why it happened even if he didnt do it after all he does have the same last name and this mistake wouldnt have happened if that was not the case <>
so you see the direction this film is going it is cartoonish in characterization with ridiculous dialogue plenty of zany characters and no discernible plot <>
stars make cameo appearances and do their shticks even if it adds nothing to the plot <>
the john turturro one where he plays the flaming mexican queen is particularly funny <>
the absurd story goes on with the big lebowski hiring the dude to be a private detective for him and get back his kidnapped wife bunny tara <>
but since the dude is just being setup it really doesnt matter that he is not qualified for the job even if he does take this job to be a serious one and his dim observations of things are humorously abetted by his friends even dimmer observation of things which makes things really seem absurd <>
{2} the comedy here is sometimes so sharp that you could roll in the aisle with laughter and not seem any odder than the characters you see onscreen <>
the john goodman character of the hottempered exsoldier and adage prone advisor to the dude is hysterically funny <>
in one bit he tells one of his bowling opponents this is not nam this is bowling <>
there are rules <>
everything about john goodmans character will apply to his tour of duty there whether or not it is relevant to the situation <>
{1} it is not as good a film overall as fargo but it is funny enough to be a minor work in the coen brothers continuing attack on our sitcom culture <>
it also added a nice touch by having sam eliott with his rich melodic voice garbed as a cowboy do the voiceover adding touches of inane wisdom such as his saying in mock seriousness sometimes you get the bear sometimes the bear gets you <>
this only adds more absurdity to a story that was already bizarre to begin with <>

{1} this successful nyc wendy macleod play a black comedy about a dysfunctional nuclear family revolves around parkers jackieo obsession with the kennedy assassination and is chockfull of ironies jackie confuses kennedys death with her fathers flight from home on that same day in <>
{-2} the films major fault is that it is too stagy a production <>
{0} parker is fond of dressing up as jackieo wearing a tacky pink suit and pillbox hat around her georgetown mansion and reenacting the kennedy assassination with her twin brother marty played by josh hamilton acting as the president <>
she once shot him with real bullets during one of those stagings when she thought he would be leaving her <>
their relationship includes incest something he feels isnt normal even if he derives great satisfaction from it <>
but she doesnt agree with him on his judgment about what is or is not normal <>
she is of course a certifiable nut job committed to a mental institution after the shooting incident <>
{1} parker is still overly possessed with her twin brother even though he is now living in nyc and wishes to stay clear of her for good <>
the other brother anthony is played by prinze with a panache for bringing out his characters creepiness <>
he is weird slowwitted and obnoxious but he does not have the same kind of depraved sexual relationship with parker as josh does <>
bujold is the eccentric mother who might or might not have killed her husband the day after the kennedy assassination <>
he might have just left them like the family claims happened <>
in any case he no longer lives with them in their washington mansion and has not been heard from since <>
{-1} during a thanksgiving day hurricane josh pays a surprise visit to the family so that he can introduce his fiance tori to them <>
she is cute but not too swift and is as straight as an arrow <>
josh likes the fact that she is so ordinary and is happy that she works in a donut shop and is almost ecstatic that she is witless <>
she is naturally nervous about meeting the family and knows nothing about their infamous history <>
the only one in the family who takes a liking to her is prinze who wishes to take her away from his brother <>
mother hates her with a passion and jackie o cant wait to get rid of her <>
i found toris performance to be lacking in spunk especially when compared to the fine ensemble cast she is surrounded by <>
{1} how much you like this film depends on your idea of comedy and how much tolerance you have for sick humor <>
if this kind of parody over the tragedy that rocked the country upsets you and you think it is in bad taste then you shouldnt see this film <>
if your reaction is like mine then you will find that when this picture is on the mark which is quite often you will laugh aloud and when it misses the mark you might even wince <>
the real flaw in the film is when it starts to take its comedy seriously and thinks it has to explain itself and come up with an academic explanation for the parker characters obsession <>
it would have been better to have just ridden the comedy out and have been criticized by those who didnt like where the comedy was going <>
it seemed unnecessary to have changed the mood of the film and all of sudden offered some psychological explanations for jackio behavior <>
{2} the staple in the film was parker posey the princess of the indie film <>
she simply steals the film <>

{1} this film based on carl sagans novel is a mixture of scifi romance sentimentality and drama brought to screen by the director of forreset gump <>
it relies on its ideas and its mild convictions to sustain its powerful but soppy story rather than its special effects contrary to many modern films that have just become special effect vehicles <>
the ellie arroway jodie role as a child of is played by jena malone who is being raised by her father with tender loving care her mother died at childbirth and with respect for her ability to learn as he encourages her interest in astronomy <>
unfortunately he dies of a heart attack when she is just ten <>
{0} at last we see ellie grownup as an independent intelligent young lady working for the national science foundation on a project of cuttingedge technology <>
jodie foster is feisty vulnerable appealing selfrighteous and obsessed with seeking scientific truths <>
she is the alterego for sagan challenging the scientific and religious dogmas of the day championing a call for poetry and vision in our lives <>
{0} her boss palmer joss matthew feels her research is futile and of no utilitarian value <>
he stops her alien contact project and is pictured as the perfect bureaucrat <>
governments seem to trust this type and like to put them in charge of things <>
{-2} ellie falls for a spiritual popularizer of worldly causes tom skeritt who left divinity school because he didnt want to remain celibate <>
the attraction between them is overshadowed by idealogical differences and nothing can get in the way of ellies belief in evolution not even this hunk who is a ridiculously loopy caricature of a religious zealot one of those religious johnnycomelately types <>
s r hadden john hurt comes to her rescue as an eccentric wealthy scientist on the lookout for adventurious scientists his foundation privately sponsors her research <>
ellie succeeds in making contact with some sort of life in outer space and the government with michael kitz james woods in charge of security coopts her project for national security reasons <>
here the story turns melodramatic and goes off on too many different tangents to adequately keep its focus on its primary aim that there is life in outer space <>
for these scenes the film should have used the dictum from occams razor the simplest way to do something is the best way <>
{-1} as a scifier with a good storyline that tends to get too schmaltzy this film is up to par with those star wars films but is outclassed by <>
sagan would have been proud of the accuracy and content of this work had he lived to see the film through to its conclusion but i dont think he would have been to happy with the elementaryschool theological debate between the space pioneer and the government officials <>
the main argument in the film is when jodi is asked by that government panel whether she believes in the god of the bible <>
it is an embarrassing scene as she waivers not trying to answer the question directly because if she said she didnt believe in god they wouldnt let her go up in space <>
i think the best answer a scientist could give in this scenario was not given by jodi but then again she got to go up in space <>
a steven hawkings might have said that it is through these scientific machines that we will come closest to reading the mind of god <>
