{} the film opens with popaul yanne a veteran of years army service recently returned to his birthplace perigord region to be the towns butcher taking over his fathers butcher store upon his death as we see him joyously cutting some slices of meat for the wedding celebration of the teacher leon hamel mario beccara whos marriage is being celebrated in this small oldfashioned french village as the butcher sits next to the smiling young and attractive headmistress of leons school helene st ephane audran <0>
{} popaul comes a courting helene making her an offer she cant resist he will personally choose the meat she gets promising her the best cuts available <0>
why popaul is not married can be explained by his army service taking him to remote spots on the globe <0>
he did not like the service saying he saw many terrible things there so many dead people as a result of war even though he was only a butcher there it had an awful affect on him <0>
{} helene comes from the city she said she came here to get away from everybody the reason is that she loved someone years ago who abruptly left her leaving her psychologically scarred and very hurt <0>
she found it very easy and gratifying to give all her love to the children <0>
the townspeople consider her to be an excellent teacher and so she lives happily alone <0>
{} soon a murdered old woman is found in the woods who was not raped <0>
this does not disturb our butcher who comes by the school offering helene a leg of lamb as if it were a bouquet <0>
helene whose whole life is focused around the school lives upstairs from the schoolroom she teaches in <0>
popaul is respectful of her as she chooses to remain friendly but aloof from him as this strange relationship is bound by a certain chemistry they might have for each other even though they are very different in temperament <0>
{} the most memorable scene in the film is when the children are on an outing in the woods and one of the girls is about to bite into her roll when a red spot appears on it looking like jam <0>
it turns out to be blood dripping down from a body on the cliff above them <0>
when helene goes to examine the body she discovers its her colleagues new bride <0>
she also picks up a cigarette lighter that she gave to the butcher as a birthday present <0>
it is puzzling that she doesnt tell this to the police detective who questions her <0>
that she doesnt say anything but continues seeing popaul strikes me as odd <0>
but this is what adds to the flavor of this methodically simple story <1>
the flawed characters are what elevate this film into something other than a straight mystery story because getting the murderer is not the theme of the film as much as trying to understand something that is complex about human nature <1>
{} by now we are familiar with life in the village we have seen the statue of the soldier in the village square by the schoolhouse everytime someone visits the school it is as if he was guarding the sacredness of this school and is a symbol of how society ruins its young men with untold wars <0>
{} it is hard to figure what is happening internally in the budding relationship between popaul and helene but it is definetly not a sexual one <0>
perhaps it could be explained from her vantage point that she is curious about him and welcomes his occasional company but does not want to get emotionally attached to him <0>
{} when he comes over to paint her house he notices the lighter and retrieves it <0>
all thats left for chabrol to wrap up the film is for him to have the butcher come face to face with the mistress he loves and for us to see if redemption through love is possible <0>
it seems that he has been exposed for the first time in his life to someone he can love but since this respectful kind of love has not fulfilled him it has instead released demons inside him <0>
of course it not clear who to blame for such horrendous crimes whether it is a father he hated or society or just something inside him that snapped <0>
that was pretty much the theme chabrol used in his first film shot years before this one le beau serge which also took place in a rural village <0>
but this time the theme is more fully developed by a director who has greatly matured <2>
{} this is chabrol at his best equal to hitchcock <2>
spinning an eerie psychological thriller whose likable characters and the nostalgic village they live in are painted with a masters elegant brushstrokes <2>
it seems films such as this one never get dated <2>
i saw it when it first came out i saw it again on video in the early s and i just recently saw it again in <0>
it gets better every time i see it <1>
this time i was better able to notice the serene landscape in the background the magnificent limestone caves and the casual manner village life went on giving this film a very natural atmosphere <2>
as a result this is a very satisfying film <2>

{} this is top notch filmmaking by a director who when he is on the mark is as good as anyone in the business <2>
sthane audran is frique a wealthy woman with lesbian leanings who on a whim picks up a young attractive impoverished parisian sidewalk artist with the unusual name of why sassard <0>
she takes her to her other home in st tropez and introduces her to how the wealthy live <0>
what complicates their relationship even further is the arrival of paul trintignant a handsome and talented architect who immediately makes love with why but soon finds he has more in common with frique so the two of them become lovers <0>
paul shows a keen interest in having a bisexual menageatrois but frique is determined to keep him for herself <0>
{} the film is divided into a number of segments that ask questions about the lead characters questions they cannot readily ask about themselves <0>
{} that chabrol has the audacity to weave a story around these three diverse characters each searching for something inside them that remains a mystery to them plays well against the unmitigated sexual yearnings and need to experience sex these three have in common <1>
it is a way to look at the s that is through the lenses of these materialists who seemed to shun that periods more typical cultural revolution <1>
the womens search is a personal one it is for some kind of comfort that can take away their loneliness <0>
by all indications they could care less about art or the world <0>
why knows she is not a good artist and frique could care less <0>
pauls search remains more of a mystery as his only other interest besides these two women is the love he has for his work <0>
{} though the sex is not explicit its tenseness is what is felt as an obsession as frique and paul feel a happiness in their love that fills a void in their life that they couldnt find before <0>
why is the odd one out but cant accept her fate as she begins to transform changing her look and style so that she could become a clone for frique <0>
once she has tasted this lifestyle she cant go back to being a virgin sidewalk artist again <0>
paul being the most intuitive of the three senses a danger in the house which also has two gay robue and riais freeloading sychophants there who are nasty sorts having outlived their usefulness to frique and are asked by her unceremoniously to leave <0>
{} what makes this one of chabrols better films is the unexpected resources of the characters to pull off this emotionally draining story the females the very fragile does of the film and the male who is the hunter wrestle with the ambiguities of their sexual intentions and inclinations as it leads up to the tragic ending <1>
their emotionally desperate situation always seems to be one step beyond their reach as they get deeper and deeper into an unresolvable situation with the film ending on its bleakest note with a certain amount of vagueness still remaining that is befitting a film that has told its story with all the style and clarity it could muster <1>

{} the phone rings at am in the home of advertising man chris lloyd bale and his wife marion watson and their baby girl <0>
when the phone rings that early marion says she expects bad news <0>
its and this bourgeois couple in their early s who live in the london suburb of eastwood a community once optimistically dubbed the place of the future that had plans to link this commuter railroad all over england and to the continent but all that fell through and it it is now just a typical bedroom suburban community with a train to the city <0>
a retired commuter wood will tell chris on his last commute after years that metroland is not a place but a state of mind <0>
{} the trouble on the phone turns out to be toni ross the best friend of chris and a reminder of his rebellious days as a bohemian in the s and someone marion detests for his anger and the blame he casts on others for his failure to be a recognized poet <0>
in other words she knows that he is a phony <0>
but he is chris lifelong friend someone he has lost contact with for the past years except for the occasional postcard like the one that said africas where its happening <0>
vibrant culture <0>
great people <0>
thinking of hanging out here for a while <0>
eat the rich <0>
love toni <0>
if i got a postcard like that i would think of getting a new best friend <0>
anyway that starts a rather predictable meeting with his old friend and the beginning of a clicheridden story about a midlife crisis that the restless chris is having with his decision to live in the suburbs as he is yearning for the good old days of being free from marriage and responsibilities <0>
toni upon meeting him tells him he has become like his parents <0>
{} this is a story which turns out to be so flat and without emotion and plays like a film you can almost swear you saw before even if you didnt thats how forgettable and regretable the story and the acting are <-2>
it almost makes you wonder what the filmmaker is trying to say about this trite conundrum his protaganist has <-1>
the film never comes to any surprises or reveals anything you wouldnt have known if you didnt see the film <-1>
which is why i would think the sensible thing to do for those who value how they spend their time would be to avoid this one <-1>
at least thats what i would do if i had it to do over <0>
but thats not to say that the film was so terrible that it cant be seen that would not be true since it is not so bad as it is a case of it being so dull that it negates any enjoyment value <1>
{} toni fills chris in on his life telling him that he was teaching a writing course in california and seducing his female students isnt that charming and being a worldwide traveller <0>
he is also someone who is constantly berating his friend for being bourgeois without even asking him if he is happy about his decision to go from being a freelance photographer living in paris to such a hopelessly middleclass situation here <0>
why toni is a poet we have to take as a statement of fact coming from the filmmaker because he appears like an obnoxious jerk and an actor who is badly miscast and there was no evidence given in the film that he shows even enough intelligence to spell poet let alone to even consider him to be a poet <-2>
{} the film flips back and forth between the beatlemaniaera of the early s and the suburbs of the s as it uses the means of flashback to show chris then and now as he wonders how his life would have turned out if he stayed with his upfront sexually free girlfriend in paris annick zylberstein who had no trouble fitting in with the other actors playing their parts as she also gave a zombielike performance <-1>
chris as a bohemian was too pathetic to seriously believe and not funny enough to laugh at <0>
but what was really laughable was the filmmakers bourgeois conception of what a bohemian is <-1>
{} whats left for the story to tell are those predictable scenes of the friend who is not the friend he pretends to be but someone who is jealous of his friend material comforts and satisfying marriage <0>
the task of getting all this straight for our befuddled heros handsome head is his solid wife and she will tell our hero this even if he finds it so hard to believe <0>
{} in one flashback scene i was personally annoyed to hear one of my favorite french directors robert bresson have his name being dropped by chris when he asks annick do you want to see a film <-1>
theres a new bresson playing <0>
this film will not be mistaken for a bresson <-2>
trust me on that <0>
{} the film was able to muster one great line of dialogue and it comes from marion as she tells her hapless hubby you will get married because you are not original enough not to <1>
the worst line in the movie is when chris realizes he has a good thing going with marion and tells her his reason for not fooling around with another woman who wants fastfood if you can eat at the ritz <-1>

{} if you want a brand new hard body blue nissan pickup for free you might consider entering a contest from an auto dealership in longview texas taking place every spring where contestants are chosen from a lottery <0>
in this filmed contest where there were contestants the winner of the pickup will be the last one standing upright no leaning or squatting allowed with the winner having at least one gloved hand the glove is to avoid any scratches on the truck <0>
{} the other rules of the contest include a mandatory drug test when the contest gets down to three people <0>
a second prize of and a third prize of a gift certificate at a local store to appease the contestants who have gone so far but failed <0>
there are minute breaks every hour and after hours there is a minute break <0>
{} the dealerships crude advertising gimmick seemingly exploits the bluecollar type of participants undergoing this lunacy who will go without sleep for days and will battle exhaustion the heat and the mosquitoes <0>
this makes for a different type of documentary one with a less serious tone than most others but one that is fun to watch as the varied contestants of different ages sizes genders and races each have their idea on what it takes for them to win <0>
the thing they have most in common is that they want the truck the question is how much do they want it <0>
{} a previous winner the cowboy sage benny perkins who went for some hours without sleep to win his truck two years ago offers his view on what it takes to win this endurance test in an interview shot before the contest began and was shown throughout the contest of which he was again an entrant and was considered the favorite because of his previous experience <0>
he contends that it is mental toughness that is required and maturity and knowing how to get comfotable and eat light food during the breaks <0>
he doubts if anyone under will win unless he is a former marine with that disciplined mindset <0>
he calls this event a human drama thing rather than a contest <0>
{} bindlers camera crew was there night and day to chronicle the event along with voluntary judges and family and friends cheering on the contestants as the documentary became about why and how the participants entered the contest and why they are still in it <0>
bindler is a native of that texas city though the yearold went away to study at new york university film school but returned to film the event he recalled as something he thought was absurd but didnt know what else to make of it <0>
{} some of the contestants who were singled out for interviews were the ones whose personalities stood out whom we saw at different hours and in different frames of mood and in alternating physical conditions <0>
{} norma is an obese hispanic woman who is a fervant christian <0>
she believes god wants her to win the truck and she has a prayer group of some two hundred members from her church praying for her to win <0>
to keep alert she listens to gospel music on her radio headphones and sometimes goes into fits of joyous laughter to keep her spirits up <0>
russell welsh needs to get a truck to replace his other one after a tough year <0>
kelly mangrum is an attractive student who wants braces and will sell the truck to meet some of her other expenses <0>
greg is an exmarine who believes he has the youth and physical stamina to win <0>
janis is distinctively missing a few front teeth and says she always finishes what she starts <0>
ronald is a black country boy who says he will fast for three days but is seen eating snickers during the breaks <0>
he wishes there was no tent over his head because he loves the heat and he thinks the tent helps the others more than it does him <0>
j d drew is the oldest contestant and is an avid deer hunter who described how he stood patiently for long periods to get his prey <0>
angie learns that she didnt prepare properly for the contest and quits when she becomes disorientated saying she doesnt think she would ever do it again but she comes back next year and wins <0>
paul prince feels he is in great condition and thinks he can go the distance <0>
raul thinks he has what it takes to win and is seen getting a foot massage from his girlfriend <0>
{} what is magnanimous about the documentary was that even though it could have gone for the cheap joke and made fun of these people instead it takes them seriously and lets them explain in their own way why they are there <1>
the filmmaker clearly saw that what the contestants were doing was fantastic and out of the ordinary already so there was no need to embellish the story and by keeping it simple he succeeded in telling their story honestly and in a very human way <2>
these real people happened to also be likable people manifesting real concerns and problems and when people start dropping out you can see a camaraderie growing between some of these strangers others remain critical of their competitors <0>
but despite the competitiveness of the event most of them realize that they were all put through some ordeal and they went through it together and therefore shared the trip and learned something about human values <0>
the result is a quirky nondramatic human interest story about the need for texans to drive a pickup as if it was their god given right to have one <0>
and as benny said it is something to see people struggling to get what you want <0>
but at least they tried <0>
people dont want to take a risk anymore they are afraid that if they fail they will get hurt <0>
ill buy that <0>
its worth a look reminding me a little bit of that sydney pollack film they shoot horses dont they but without the cheap sentimentality pollack threw into his film <2>
it played for me more like a sports story that espn would air where the filmmaker didnt know who was going to win and many times focused on those who unexpectedly dropped out and part of the lure of the film was choosing who you think will win <0>

[17119/b-]
{} a cold thriller exploring the exploitation of violence by heaping up a huge quantity of exploitive violence itself to make some points about what is the publics attitude and tolerance level for the random violence that is present in society <0>
in other words this is an exploitive violent film railing against exploitive violent films if that makes sense <0>
it holds to the socalled philosophy of fighting fire with fire <0>
by crafting an intelligent screenplay and not going for the unnecessary showing of gore much of this is done offscreen which might be almost as horrific as seeing the actual mayhem the director is able to keep the film arty <-1>
but by playing with the publics prurient interest in violence as a way of life something they have been numbed into accepting as part of their television and mtv inheritance this powerful story has a chilling affect on rationality questioning the viewing habits and the responses to violence the public has <1>
{} this film is about a wealthy welleducated couple georg and anna ulrich and suzanne and their young son georg jr stefan going to their isolated luxurious lakeside summer resort home to do some boating golfing and escape from the summer heat <0>
a polite cleancut intruder peter frank comes in to borrow eggs from them for their neighbor and wont leave turning rude as his partner also cleancut paul arno soon arrives to torment the couple smacking georgs knee with a golf club so that he is disabled for the remainder of this hostage situation and is unable to properly defend his family <0>
there is also the most riveting scene in the movie where anna is forced to strip subject to possible rape while her son is blindfolded and her husband is forced to answer ridiculous questions <0>
the hostage situation is barely watchable the mental torture the couple is put through is sickening these psychologically sadistic murderers offer no true explanation for their actions using mockery and cynical responses to mask the power trip they are on <-1>
they have no redeeming human features and their cruel intent is played up for the cameras benefit paul even winks at the camera as if the audience is in on this game they are playing <0>
in one of the scenes the camera is rewound when the audience is given the gratuitous pleasure in seeing one of the sadists killed but even this is not granted to the audience when the scene is finally rewound <0>
{} what remains to be comprehended is how a family trying to survive and hold onto to their dignity can manage in the best way they can as these misfits play games with them pretending to give them choices in choosing their suffering but always telling them that they will kill them before they leave <0>
these thugs are complete fakes even their names are fictitious as they keep referring to themselves with different names such as tom and jerry beavis and butthead <0>
paul calls peter fatty several times to the mock displeasure of peter tom beavis or whoever this obese snide monster really is <0>
everything about these two is a facade their phony stories of who they are and how they were brought up their pretenses at politeness add up to zero for an audience that is left dismayed realizing that it is only their evil that is real in this film despite the directors aim to fictionalize the reality of this fictitious situation to reduce everyone to a cartoon image to make it appear that we can grow to expect violence as a natural part of life <0>
that part doesnt work as well as the director might think it does <-1>
the family is real to the audience <0>
georgs lack of courage and quiet in the face of danger leaves him distraught unable to face himself <0>
annas resolute behavior and her human foibles make us sympathize with her even more so even if we are not particularly enamored by the way she deports herself when she is in control of things and the sons confusion touches us deeply as we see him look for direction to his now helpless parents a nightmare for any parent to be in a situation where you cant protect your child <0>
{} i am left with the choice of how to rate the movie knowing full well that the sophist argument is if you dont like what you are seeing then dont see the rest of it <-1>
thats well and good <0>
and if that is your philosophy on how to how to handle exploitive material i cant condemn you for it <0>
i would think that many people of sound mind would feel this way and will walk out of the theater <-1>
but i dont think as the director thinks in an interview he gave that people who stay to see the entire movie really need the movie <-1>
i dont necessarily need this movie <-1>
i stayed to see if this sadistic film works its point of view out and i was disappointed that with all its novelty and games and pretenses to high art it offered nothing much in the way of seeing things differently <-1>
the film is successful not because of its message but because it is a wellcrafted film from a filmmaker who knows how to make films even if he pretends to be doing more than he is capable of <-1>
this film succeeds with the small share of the audience it can garner because it is surprisingly enough an entertaining film and it broaches a subject that is very difficult to understand that tweaks our interest in seeing if there is anything new to say about violence <1>
and the hope is that we might be able to understand violence a little bit better even if it has to come to us by way of an unorthodox position and that maybe since violent films are so universally popular we can somehow see the human condition on film and not be anesthetized by the reality of violence <0>
{} as far as the critical success of this film goes i think it is merely a better version of all those halloween grizzly killing pictures we are subjected to if you want a high class texas chainsaw massacre film <-1>

[19994/c+]
{} chabrol continues to make original films in his own inimical style some very successful others not quite hitting the mark <0>
this one is a theological mystery that is done in english from an ellery queen novel <0>
it is supported by a fine cast who set an eerie mood for a story that will involve adultery madness blackmail deception jealousy theology and murder <1>
its results are mixed being that it succeeds as something different from most thrillers but it is rather chaotically done <1>
at times it looks as if it were a b movie <-1>
{} perkins overthetop portrayal of the manic charles is eye catching <1>
he has sex with his fathers wife helene marlene his young stepmother <0>
this is done in the handsome style chabrol has come to be known for when he wants to raise eyebrows about the bourgeoisie <0>
charles is the adopted son of theo orson who found him on the doorsteps of his house and decided to keep him <0>
theo is an eccentrically wealthy man who owns just about everything in the village they live in <0>
in he built his excessively palatial dream mansion with rooms needing seven servants to take care of the occupants and the vast grounds <0>
{} we first come across charles in a hotel room as he awakens from a religious dream all covered with blood <0>
he suffers from memory loss of how he spent the last four days <0>
worried about this he calls his old college philosophy professor piccoli who he has not seen for years but of whom he has fond memories <0>
he invites the professor to be his guest at the mansion hoping that the professor can piece things together for him <0>
he tells of his relationship with his fathers wife shows him his studio where he has done classical greek sculptures of such deities as jupiter and he mentions that he is being blackmailed having written love letters to helene that were stolen and now are in the possession of the blackmailer <0>
{} to pay off the blackmail ransom charles steals from his fathers safe making it look like a robbery <0>
but the blackmailer calls again saying he has photostats of the original letters <0>
this time helene pawns her diamond necklace as charles has the professor do the actual pawning of it <0>
this backfires as theo discovers that the necklace is missing and reports that to the police <0>
they bring the pawnbroker to his house where he identifies the professor as the one who pawned it <0>
theo wants to know why and the professor tells him to ask his son <0>
charles gets angry with the professor for implicating him in the theft and rebuffs the professor <0>
{} the film begins to make sense if you view it from the unique theological spin it puts on the story <0>
by coincidence on the train back to paris the professor overhears a little girl talk about god and the ten commandments the film takes its title by comparing the ten days leading up to the main event in this story with the precepts found in the ten commandments <0>
the professor figures out that theo is playing god and by realizing his imperfections jealousy overcomes him <0>
thereby he cant control his urge to destroy <0>
but the professor arrives too late and a murder is committed to make it appear like a suicide with the intention of blaming all the robberies on the mentally disturbed charles <0>
{} this unique film is both awkward and mesmerizing and at all times tantalizing our sensiblities <-2>
it seems to want to question how deep our faith is in god which is a recurring theme in many chabrol films <0>
the answers are skewed as chabrol is cynical enough to believe that the rich can get away with anything including murder <0>
the professor the hero of the story walks away from all this with a clear conscience <0>
but theo remains godlike charming the public and buying them off with his wealth making sure that they are only aware of his benevolent side <0>
this is a film that might seem better the second and third time you view it than it does at first <1>

[21495/c]
{} a tepid comedydrama involving a wealthy nurse judith holly hunter who is miserable even talking aloud to herself in public you know like crazy people do <0>
she was dumped for a younger woman after sixteen years of marriage by her cardiologist husband dr bob nelson donovan <0>
in her fifth avenue luxury coop where she lives we will regularly see her entering the lobby dressedup in evening clothes after a night out on the town <0>
she will regularly come across the also divorced doormanelevator man pat devito but never notice him until this one night when she feels talkative and there is no one for her to talk to but him <0>
he is feeling blue because his wife has kicked him out some time ago after years of marriage something he has never gotten over and recently his beloved daughter passed away <0>
he also has some heavy gambling debts but doesnt have the money to settle up with the gangsters he owes the money to <0>
the lonely judith starts a conversation on the elevator with him and this starts their unlikely friendship <0>
admittedly pat is attracted to her having more than a friendship in mind with the comely woman <0>
loneliness seems to be her only reason for making contact with someone she has nothing in common with <0>
into the mix of this new friendship you can add the busty nightclub singer at judiths favorite nightspot liz bailey queen latifah <0>
she becomes her provider of wisdom <0>
though she is also divorced and admittedly is no crackerjack in dealing with relationships yet she seems to be handling her divorce in a more worldly manner than her new friends <0>
{} as you might surmise from a mainstream film like this it wants to pull you along with all the heartaches it can muster from these lonely souls and it does so by making use of semi flashbacks and scenes that have a mixture of fantasy and reality to it <2>
we continually hear judiths bitter thoughts pour out from her as she tries to get another life for herself <1>
to a lesser degree this style of filmmaking also works for the less complicated pat as his mental grief comes pouring out in spurts <1>
his thoughts are geared to getting all he can out of life as he tries desperately to just be himself needing only a little help from family to secure a business and get over his gambling debts <0>
{} the films title living out loud is deliberately misleading as it should really be retitled as fantasizing out loud <0>
the problem for these two is that they never found out who they were in their marriage so when their marriages fell apart so did they <0>
in other words they are not living out loud from what is on their mind they are merely fantasizing what is on their mind <0>
{} this therefore becomes a film more intrigued with selfawareness than with relationships and loses its edge as a romantic film <1>
its brightest hope is how the viewer relates to the films stars <0>
i didnt so the film just seemed to drag for me at times and it seemed manipulative to the bargain <-2>
my problem is that i didnt really care what happened to them <0>
why they were sad and lonely is a sympathetic enough story but there was just nothing served up that made me feel that this predictable story had anywhere important to go <-1>
the only innovative feature of the film which did save it from the doldrums was that we were able to go inside their heads and hear their thinking process at work <1>
the filmmaker has borrowed this guise of introspection from the pages of chekhov which works out reasonably well on film though it is still better served as a device for the reader of books <1>
{} at least the film never turns to mush as its static atmosphere is enhanced mostly by some of the lively nightclub scenes such as when liz is belting out her sultry jazz numbers and offering good cheer for advice trust me it wasnt on a par to the biblical solomons advice <-1>
she mops up the screen with her bosomy and glittering presence and dwarfs the other costars when onscreen together <0>
{} fortunately the story itself was somewhat believable of the need for the two loners to use each other in a nice way to find a path in their life to take them out of their doldrums and to find out who they are <1>
but i couldnt picture them falling in love for even a second and certainly not for a minute these two were just not compatable <0>
she being cultured and upperclass and aspiring to be a pediatrician and pat who is unappealing to her physically and is a coarse uneducated man and he is a dullard <0>
but come to think of it shes pretty dull herself <0>
{} on a positive note the selfpity of the two is handled deftly by the director and the releases the two find for their tension are very human vices to have his being gambling and hers drinking too many dry martinis and talking aloud to herself fantasizing <1>
{} the pathetic nature of how their lives have turned out and of how far down they have sunk comes across in moments such as when judith mistakes the wrong door for the bathroom in a nightclub and is suddenly pounced on by a man kissing her passionately elias koteas <0>
that he turns out to have made a mistake expecting a married woman at the bar to join him for the kiss doesnt deter her from not only forgiving him for the mistake but becoming attracted to him especially when she finds him to be harmless and civil <0>
needless to say her fantasies sustain her while she is trying to get a grip on her life but one cant live by fantasy alone <0>
or can they <0>
the fantasy she has of making it with the hunk masseur cibrian who gives her the sex massage she dreams of are the kind of private thoughts that perhaps more people have than what is commonly thought but this is certainly not a way to selfdiscovery and a way out of her situation though it seems to help her in someway but the film has really not made it clear how she was helped <0>
her other big selfdiscovery about herself comes when she acts out a fantasy at a lesbian afterhours nightclub <0>
this becomes another bridge taken between reality and fantasy and it was the most spirited moment of the film as she lived out her white woman fantasy to become a black queen for the night dancing away as if she had been a lesbian all her life <0>
she will even fantasize for a moment about loving pat but the filmmaker has the good sense to keep this part of the romantic story levelheaded as her liking for him is driven only by her desperate situation and not because they are really meant for each other <0>
their relationship should turn out to be a limited and probably a temporary one like many such manhattan relationships that singles and divorcees go through when living alone in a big city <0>
{} this bittersweet romance turns out to be too dry for my taste but it is nevertheless faultlessly told and seems to be sincere in its presentation and what the heck they seem to be ok people and probably merit a tad of sympathy for their plight <0>
{} this is the first feature directed by the screenwriter lagravenese whose previous work is a mixture of some good ones some flops and some soso works the fisher king unstrung heroes a little princess the bridges of madison county the mirror has two faces beloved <0>
his attempt here to make a combination fantasy and a straight romance film has worked with mixed results <0>
i think the major fault for the films dullness lies with the costars i couldnt get aroused by holly hunters performance as intelligent as it was it was still too plain and too staid <-2>
while danny de vito who is a natural comic and is best at being featured as a secondbanana wasnt funny enough here and couldnt be taken seriously enough as a romantic suitor for holly <-1>
im not saying that he was completely miscast he did bring some depth to his characters anguished situation and believability to his role <1>
but someone else a more romantic leading man might have given the film a romantic tension to it that it desperately needed <-1>
though i realize the point of the story was that these two werent really suited for each other in the first place and that this was the odd twist to their nonromance <0>
but my point is that they could have been not suited for each other all right but not by such a wide margin as these two were <0>
it made the ending seem logical that their real need is not to fall in love with each other but to get their life in order and get an identity of their own <0>
but that was also too predictable an ending limiting the scope of the film <-1>

{} it is hard to believe how fictional the truth can seem at times as it is played out in earnest for this documentary without actors or script just by those involved in the crime scene <1>
as the film goes into gross detail describing the horrific murders of the three secondgraders christopher byers steven branch michael moore found with mutilated bodies on may in a wooded area near west memphis arkansas which the locals call robin hood hills and then followingup the trial of the three teens accused of this crime whose motive was attributed to their being in a satanic cult <0>
{} crime is as american as apple pie and unfortunately bizarre murders are not that uncommon on the american landscape <0>
but when the victims are three innocent yearolds emotions naturally run high that there is a public outcry to get the killers and either execute them or give them life sentences as we look at ourselves and ask who could do such a thing and why <0>
we also want those who did it caught as soon as possible we want to see how our criminal system works from police to prosecutors to lawyers to judges and to jury <0>
for most of us we have formed an opinion on how we think it works even if we realize that statistics of arrests and convictions do not tell us the whole story <0>
it is not until we see an actual trial do we sense how delicate a system we have how in the hands of forthright honest intelligent and fairminded participants the system should work fine but if that is not so we better watch out the system can backfire on us and make us scratch our heads and wonder if it is possible for justice to work <0>
and that is what this objective documentary does as it allows us into the courtroom to see how the participants do their job <0>
{} for some reason there is a separate trial for jessie miskelly the pint sized yearold who has an iq of he speaks in a slow and deliberately awkward manner and seems less intelligent than even that low score indicates <0>
he is the one the police picked up and questioned after a month of mounting pressure against them that they have bungled the case by getting a confession out of him without a lawyer present and after he at first denied doing the crime <0>
in his flimsy confession where he does not even accurately state what has happened he goes on to implicate two other friends in the crime the meek and slightly mentally deficient jason baldwin and the more intelligent and articulate damien wayne echols who antagonizes the smalltown by being into heavy metal music his favorite group being metallica and purchasing a book he got from the library on a witches movement called wicca white magic which he says he only read about and does not practice and that he also antagonizes most citizens of the town by dressing in black which his father caustically comments even johnny cash wears black <0>
in other words these three friends who were not interested in sports and appeared to be different in temperament and attitude than the rest of the town were looked upon with hostile suspicion even before the crime <0>
{} the filmmakers spend a lot of time with jesses family and with the lawyers defending him and going over his confession which he now says is not true and all of them come to the conclusion that jesse was a frightened boy who just gave that confession to get out of the police line of questioning <0>
he supposedly has an alibi for when the murders took place but the filmmakers did not reveal what his alibi was or for that matter what the other accused boys alibis were for a reason i cannot understand <-1>
in any case there is nothing to link him to the crime except for the dubious nature of the confession <0>
there is absolutely no physical evidence of any kind at the crime scene to implicate him and his friends even though all the victims bled and one lost pints of blood while bleeding to death <0>
it is highly unlikely that jessie and his passive friends would have been able to do the crime not withstanding that they had no reason to do it and then after the crime be so thorough in covering up any evidence <0>
just seeing them and hearing their story and seeing no solid proof put forward except for innuendo and a coerced confession is not what i call a solid case against them <0>
{} jessie was found guilty and given a life sentence plus years even though in his confession he claimed not to murder any one he just held down the moore boy for the others to kill <0>
it was made apparently clear that the police and the prosecutors were not looking for any reason to exonerate these three from the crime <0>
these rational men defenders of the law were satisfied and even smug with the job they were doing <0>
the job they did frightened the heck out of me because of their unwillingness to check everything out and as much as the crime revolted me this revolted me with almost equal disdain <0>
{} we also see a hair raising bit of unexpected melodrama from john mark byers stepfather of one of the victims as he is caught on videotape recreating how he thinks the murders took place calling on god for vengeance <0>
this guy was more frightening to watch than the three accused of the crime and indeed the defense team suspected him of doing the crime but since the police refused to really question this guy seriously except the man himself did say he gave his stepson a spanking for misbehaving shortly before the crime took place <0>
later on in the case presented against the two remaining defendents who are tried together he gives a knife he has to the filmmakers who turn it over to the prosecutors who find blood traces on it with his blood and his stepsons <0>
there is no follow up to the fact that he stated there was no reason for there being blood on the knife since he never used it before <0>
but under questioning from the defense attorney he now remembers cutting himself with it <0>
this is a knife that could have very likely been used in the crime <0>
{} there is also a manager of a local fast food place who said on the late afternoon of the gruesome murder he called the police to his bojangles because there was a blackman in the womans rest room with blood all over him <0>
the police even though they were aware a bloody murder had just happened did not apprehend this man or follow this lead up in their investigation <0>
{} the trial of damian and jason is hinged on the claim that they committed the act as a ritual killing for their satanic group something that the state has absolutely no evidence on but the testimony of a mail order dr who claims to be an expert on cult groups even though the accused both deny being in any kind of group and no one can offer proof that they are in such a group <0>
they call themselves loners <0>
though damian has a girlfriend he has a baby with he is not an active participant in any gang or cult <0>
on camera she states that damian couldnt harm anyone she is confident that he couldnt have done the crime <0>
jason could hardly say a word and seems to be mortified not really aware of what is going on and appears to have no connection with anything occult except he likes to hang around with damien and listen to heavy metal music <0>
{} needless to say they are convicted of the crimes even though jessie recants his confession and refuses to cut a deal with the prosecutors for a reduced sentence to testify against his friends because he would be lying and his mother said that she would be in court to watch him to make sure he doesnt tell a lie <0>
{} damian gets the death penalty while jason gets a life sentence <0>
their sentences are now under appeal <0>
{} if ever there was to be a public outcry against how the judicial system works and the arbitrary use of the death penalty this film should give you food for thought about how unfair the judicial system can be for those who are of the poor class <1>
it was frightening for me to watch how the process works <0>
there is no outcry from the community about injustice and even if this case is the exception to the way the courts operate that most cases are handled with more of a search for justice and with less of a rush to judgment which i sincerely doubt <0>
this compelling documentary leaves me perplexed not only in my questioning of the verdict but the whole process itself and wondering if our system is so flawed that it would really be damaging to impose a death penalty sentence on anyone realizing how political all verdicts appear to be <1>

{} another tarantino look alike indie filmed in thirteen days for and it sure gets its moneys worth for the effort <1>
the filmmaker has come up with a crimethriller spoof done at a hyperfrenetic pace that is as good if not better than most hollywood highbudget action films of this type <2>
joe carnahan is both star and director playing a fat sleazy fasttalking usedcar salesman named sid french whose partner in the bob sids auto emporium is almost as sleazy as he is but who is more practicalminded bob melba leis <0>
faced with an eviction notice their car lot located in the hinterlands of needles california have only unsellable gas guzzling cars on their lot and the boys are getting desperate to get their hands on some sellable cars <0>
{} the opening scene is a contemptuous look at the salesman trying to hustle their customers <0>
their routine runs through every bit of disdain they have for their customers and the integrity of their profession <0>
but it went on for too long and the fun subsided and soon became grating just like a bad commercial <-1>
{} but the quick pace of the film kept things moving briskly and their use of quirky titled chapters to each little skit kept the level of juvenile humor this film was imbued with at a bearable level <1>
one such chapter was titled coldblooded hotheads just to give you an idea at what the film was driving at <0>
{} their former boss and now competitor danny woo harlan whom they absolutely despise asks the boys to do him a favor the irs is doing an audit on his business and would they say nice things about him to their investigators and he will return the favor with a favor <0>
the boys agree after badmouthing him to each other and telling about all the crooked things he has done <0>
as they recall working for woo they remember him telling them that he doesnt hire salesman he hires hit men <0>
but they are envious of the big dealership he runs and the divorced bob is envious of how woo dotes on his crippled wife in such a loving manner sadly thinking of his divorce <0>
{} meanwhile they press their car broker to get them cars other than gremlins and pintos to sell and he comes by their lot with an offer that they cant refuse but are very suspicious of <0>
its a vintage pontiac le mans burgundy convertible that will soon be dropped off to them and they will be paid if they allow it to sit on the lot for two days without trying to sell it or even touch it <0>
they are told the trunk is wired to explode if they open it and there will be surveillance people watching them at all times armed with shotguns to kill them if they try to weasel out of the deal <0>
{} the car has a history to it as the fbi is aware that a driver of that car was killed by car jackers and they suspect a drug smuggling operation going on that is connected with the stolen car and with the recent deaths of a tribe of indians in ecuador where the car was spotted <0>
also butchered bodies are turning up on the road and in a garbage dump that have a connection to the stolen car <0>
{} sid talks his partner into extorting ransom for the car from the ones phoning them <0>
believing they are being setup as they manage to get away from the redneck shooting at them they drive the car to a mechanic they know and have him inspect it <0>
he tells them they are riding in a car with nitroglycerine in it and that there is blood dripping from the trunk but those details cant stop them from going to the meeting place where they arranged to collect their money <0>
{} the film comes to its slick ending after the last rendezvous point is arranged with the ponytailed blond psycho killer hugh mcchord who is the main hit man for the big boss <0>
a number of preposterous twists come about as the film winds its way to its final payoff where we see suitcases filled with money being exchanged cocaine lined up in the trunk in plastic baggies all sorts of highpowered guns exhibited and mysterious packets of blood <-1>
the immoral main characters end up talking about what is right and wrong with themselves and the world they live in which adds a nice touch of absurdity to the already absurd story <-1>
{} the film had energy a ready made metaphor in the pontiac and the usedcar lot a semiplausible plot some promise in the filmmakers ability to tell a story some choppy dialogue that could be amusing at times and enough nerve from the actors who at times improvised and got by with it as it looked better than a film school film which is what it most reminded me of <2>
it was not innovative enough to be a superior work it needlessly displayed too much homage to other contemporary indies to make this film seem special <-1>
yet it was engaging and at times very funny <2>

{} we have to wait until the near end of this love triangle a bleak drama about lowlife angst to hear the words of the cole porter tune of which this film takes its title from spoken by eddie sean to joey travolta she doesnt love you she doesnt love me shes delovely <0>
but even these words dont make sense as we find out soon afterwards that their wife definetly loves one of them more than the other <0>
maureen robin is the exwife of eddie and the current wife of joey <0>
she is also the reallife wife of sean <0>
{} maureen and eddie are a couple who love each other madly but have many problems such as booze drugs and eddies habit of disappearing from timetotime <0>
during one of these disappearing acts the pregnant maureen is savagely beaten up and probably raped by her neighbor kiefer gandolfini but when eddie returns she is afraid to tell him this fearing he will kill the neighbor <0>
so when she lies to him and tells him the marks on her face are from a fall he doesnt believe her and goes into a rage forcing her to call ems <0>
but this backfires and eddie shoots one of the attendants as a result he is sent away to the mental house for years <0>
when he gets out his wife who never visited him while he was institutionalized has divorced him and remarried a successful construction company owner joey who raises the yearold she had with eddie plus raising their own two daughters <0>
but she now must choose which is the one she really loves and wants to stay with <0>
{} the film wants to look like a hip independent movie even though this john cassavetess scripted work he died in directed by his son is a hollywood produced movie <0>
it ends up looking not quite like a john cassavetes independent film should look <-1>
it seems to be written as if someone thought that it would be cute to keep leaving out key parts to the story <-1>
as a result the film suffers from incohesiveness but because of the caliber of actors involved they make a cassavetes sandwich seem like it is a cassavetes sandwich even if there is not much real cassavetes in the sandwich <-1>
in other words the story just wasnt there it didnt seem to be original and this from a script by the real mccoy of indie films is astonishing to say the least even the ending of the film feels like a blatant rip off of the graduate <-1>
{} the film however managed to be entertaining <1>
it just mostly lacked insight into what these characters were about <-1>
nothing was resolved or could be fully understood <-1>
for example it made no sense to think that eddie was well enough to be let free from the institution and still didnt know that he was there for a decade not for three months <-1>
too many other things about the movie were either murky or didnt add up unless you are willing to except anything goes as a satisfactory story line when it comes to dealing with those who are unstable <-1>
{} what worked for me was the comic reactions by both stanton and travolta it broke the heavy barrage of emoting from the penns <1>
i also thought that gandolfini did an excellent job in his brief appearance on screen <1>
he held my attention with his mix of manic sadistic moves and cruel humor <1>
without them this film would have taken itself too serious for the untasty cassavetes sandwich it was trying to serve its too willing captives in the audience <-1>

[17108/b+]
{} a brilliant witty mock documentary of jean seberg that puts words in her mouth that she might have approved of but did not actually say these are mark rappaports words <2>
proving once again that she is being exploited though in a benevolent way by a film that rails against her exploitation <1>
she was exploited by the director who discovered this yearold in a nationwide star search for an unknown to play the juicy part in his saint joan that is the irrepressible otto preminger the charming party guest the publicity hound and the tyrannical director for women and her second husband romaine gary who poked fun at her political views and humiliated her in his films <0>
there was also the brief affair with the future star clint eastwood which meant nothing to him and everything to her and the f b i under j edgar hoover spreading malicious rumors about her falsely saying she was pregnant with a black child trying everything possible to ruin her career and life <0>
{} mary beth hurt is a perfect jean seberg looking and sounding like her exhibiting the easy way she talked reflecting her smalltown midwestern iowa roots <2>
this journal a journal that she never kept takes us through her innocent years up to her suicide in when she was and was resolved in the knowledge that she couldnt be the somebody that she wasnt <1>
{} rappaport interestingly explores the early film life of vanessa redgrave and jane fonda who started out the same time she did and were roughly the same age and were exploited as much as she was but who survived to find their own identity and stardom <0>
the difference between their success and her failure he points out is that these stars had a distinguished family name to see them through <0>
this film is as much about them as it is about her covering the film industry with the knowledge that it is called showbiz he says not showart <0>
{} her involvement with the black panthers shows that her motivation was to be of help to the downtrodden to get the kids a better education and food in their belly thinking that maybe violence was some kind of answer to the poverty and injustice she saw in the black community <0>
by this time her life had taken a downward turn she was heavily into drinking and taking drugs her judgment was certainly questionable <0>
{} preminger the egotist he was answered the critics who panned her acting ability in saint joan by giving her another starring part in one of his films realizing that they did it with such glee partly because they wanted him to fall on his face <0>
but he wouldnt admit he was wrong and immediately cast her in his next film bonjour tristesse <0>
she played the younger woman in love with an older man <0>
this is the film that the french critic and soon to be new wave cinema icon jeanlucgodard saw her in and took her to paris to play in the critically acclaimed breathless <0>
she was to appear in many films afterward but her best role might have been in a film few people saw or cared about lilith <0>
where she holds her own with such future stars and scene stealers as peter fonda and warren beatty <0>
{} this film challenges our credibility it offers a fascinating look at the world of make believe and the politics of the times telling us secrets that may or may not be true <2>
it also enlightens us that sebergs stare into the camera was basically a nono for an actor to do at that time but is now acceptable making her a trend setter <1>
in the voiceover he says that she felt the camera was stealing her soul <0>
this is a clever film immensely satisfying and enjoyable and fortunately the director casts jean in a favorable light she seems to deserve that <2>

[17811/b]
{} what gets into the headlines determines how most of us view the world <0>
when the civil outbreak in bosnia reared its ugly head it had the unwanted task of painfully reminding the rest of the world that this troubled area was coming back to haunt the world again <0>
hatred of other ethnic groups has never gone away even in the relative calm of titos postwar yugoslavia <0>
now that ethnic war is here again with a particular vengeance as ethnic cleansing becomes a government policy pitting serbs against muslims the problem is dangerously out in the open <0>
{} in this film the first welcome to sarajevo you get to this forsaken region with burnt out buildings and visable carnage everywhere after briefly seeing the joy in the faces of a family coming out of a church from a wedding is them being suddenly startled by the shots fired by snipers as a bullet strikes the mother of the bride killing her instantly as you watch her lying on the street as reporters snap their photos from a safe distance until her body is removed by a priest and flynn woody who is a loud mouth american reporter who backs up his big talk with brave deeds making him a likable enough person among the other foreign reporters covering the war and a bit of comic relief for the audience <0>
the film will try to depict the horrors of the war on the civilian population balanced against the medias reaction to what they are covering who are only there for the story of the day but are caught in the harsh reality of the situation surrounded by constant danger they are trying to find a way to keep things in perspective for themselves to get their story while remaining sane about the madness enveloping them to do whatever they can to make some difference in the conflict even if they act somewhat glib in doing their job <0>
but there is no way for a reporter to put out of his mind that more than civilians died in this bosnian war and of the countless other human tragedies that are so numerous that most go unreported <0>
{} winterbottom focuses on the true story of a british tv reporter who grew miffed at his stations uncommitted coverage and shifted gears on them by going to an orphanage and doing a human interest story but getting so entangled with his emotions that he ends up adopting an abandoned girl living and working in the orphanage bringing her back to great britain with him by using some guile to make this illegal adoption possible <0>
stephen dillane plays henderson the british reporter who felt compassionate enough to keep his promise to the young girl to free her from the misery of her country <0>
emira nusevic plays herself with the realistic sense of danger emanating from one who actually lived through this story <1>
henderson is shown at work along with his cameraman gregg james nesbitt and his producer jane kerry fox as they compete with the rest of the media for a story and engage in untold pressures from their bosses back home <0>
goran visnjic risto is movingly portrayed as the local hired by the tv crew to do the driving and translating for them while marisa tomei nina is stereotyped as the dogooder working for a relief agency sort of a throwin role that has no depth <0>
{} since the war is precipitated at this point in history by the serbs the film has little choice but to point out that the serbs are mainly responsible for what is happening now <0>
to argue back and forth to say that atrocities are committed by everyone as it actually was during the course of this long historical conflict would not properly explain the problem that is now occuring by the genocidal practice of one side <0>
what is so forcefully happening in sarajevo even though it is on the news everyday has not caught the american peoples attention as much as you might think it would <0>
the reasons for that are manyfold but probably one of the best reasons to explain that is that the clinton adminstration was too preoccupied with domestic policies to turn its full attention on a situation it had no clear policy on and european countries also had no answers and therefore chose to safely not get involved in their own backyard affairs <0>
{} this film offers an honest portrait of the media in action as it also depicts a public that is more interested in being entertained than being informed <1>
the film makes its point by showing after a particularly disasterous slaughter caught on film it being replaced from the british front page headlines with a story about the impending separation of the duke and duchess of york <0>
it seems as if the public could care less about what is happening there <0>
so it shouldnt be all that surprising that the public also showed its indifference at the boxoffice to this heartfelt film <1>

{} a minor but most enjoyable tongueincheek hitchcockianlike spy thriller from the michael powell emeric pressburger team <1>
conrad veidt is danish captain anderson of the merchant ship helvig where he is stopped on british waters for a contraband check in and taken to a control port where he will have to wait until morning before the boat is cleared <0>
he soon discovers that his landing passes giving to him by the british have been stolen by two passengers mrs sorensen valerie hobson and mr pidgeon esmond knight which prompts anderson to row ashore in pursuit of them it will turn out that both are agents for british naval intelligence <0>
he locates them on a train bound for london but loses him and desperately clings on to her a wise choice she is very attractive <0>
in the middle of the blackout a vender is hawking gas masks and torches and the wartime atmosphere is cleverly made use of as he courts the divorced mrs sorenson despite the imminent dangers surrounding her <0>
he takes her to dine in the danish restaurant of the brother of his firstmate axel skold hay petrie and is given the royal treatment by the owner erik skold hay petrie <0>
soon the two are captured by german spies and taken for interrogation to an old nemesis of hers van dyne raymond lovell who discovers she has info about neutral ships helping the germans which are hidden on cigarette paper <0>
{} when anderson escapes being tied up he leaves her behind to make it look like they are both there and he goes back to the same restaurant and recruits the help of the staff to rescue her and capture the spies <0>
mrs sorensen then gives the real message she is carrying to her superiors and the merchant ship sails on time to denmark with everyone on board <0>
{} the brisk pace of the film and its touches of quaintness made the film seem very comically endearing inspite of the lack of any character study and the onedimensional tone of the villains <1>
the likable lovers also starred in powells the spy in black <0>
it was strange to see veidt in a romantic hero role and even though he is such a fine actor i prefer him in villain roles and wonder how much better a more romantically inclined hero would have fared in that role <-1>
{} my favorite line in the film is when veidt tells hobson why he is still not in the danish navy the smaller the ship the bigger the adventure <1>

[20538/d]
{} an uninspiring film about a muse sharon stone in hollywood helping a writer albert brooks who was stuck without a good idea for a script <-1>
this is a dull unfunny film lacking an edge to it as if the screenwriter is past his prime and maybe should take a year off to regain his touch <-2>
{} albert brooks modern romance defending your life mother latest film deals with his critique of hollywoods taste as it results in brooks turning out the same kind of film he is railing against <-1>
this sitcom film is actually worst than most sitcoms seen on tv it should have come with canned laughter <-2>
in the theater i saw it no one laughed and watching a comedy without hearing any laughs gives me a creepy feeling <-2>
the film lacked the kind of comedy expected for a satire <-1>
even if the story never took off i at least expected the film to have some snappy things to say about those who are part of the hollywood establishment and not to mirror it so closely with the hollywood scene that it cant even be considered a parody anymore <0>
i thought brooks mailed this script in <0>
all the cameo performancesrob reiner cybill shepherd martin scorsese james cameron lorenzo lamas wolfgang puck and jennifer tilly were for no avail they added nothing to the story <-2>
{} it was hard to think of brooks as a victim of hollywood when he was surrounded by so much wealth and the only thing he strove for was to become even wealthier <0>
he never asked the muse to inspire him to write a great classic only for some summer script he can sell to the studios as a blockbuster movie <0>
if he was trying for a parody which i assume he was he just didnt succeed <-1>
all he succeeded in showing was that there is some bitterness in him and that hes part of the fat cats who make up the hollywood scene too complacent to make a real satire with some bite in it <-1>
the affluent hollywood milieu of the film took away any chance but for us to see him fit right into the upscale lifestyle of those who frequent the tennis courts swimming pools and live in those mansions with guest houses <-1>
but i think the main problem with the film besides the fact that its a one idea film is how that idea was weak and never developed <-1>
the brooks character never spelled out why he was so desperate in the first place and he never showed us how good a writer he was <-1>
it was difficult to see what was his problem especially when he has a lovely wife andie macdowell whom he loves and two sweet daughters a splendid home drives a mercedes is an established hollywood writer after years in the business has good contacts there and is rich <-1>
{} i feel i must question the films intent why should i feel sorry for brooks <-1>
what is this edge that he is supposed to have lost <-1>
where is the comedy in the film <-1>
what is this nonsense about getting a live muse supposed to mean <-1>
what kind of statement is he making about creativity <-1>
should i really believe that someone would have the chutzpah to make a film about a screenwriter who lost his touch and pays for a muse so he can get that touch back and makes a film that is so flat and uninspired <-1>
is he trying to tell me that people in hollywood will believe in anything and so should i <-1>
{} the muse opens with brooks winning a humanitarian award <0>
his daughter asks him what is a humanitarian <0>
and he responds its someone whos never won the oscar <0>
and there you have the funniest line in the film and it comes right in the beginning of the film <-1>
after a meeting with a studio executive feuerstein who tells him his script is no good brooks then turns to his successful writer friend jeff bridges who suggests he contacts the same muse who helped him <0>
a muse being any one of the nine mythological greek daughters of zeus who are divine sources of inspiration but in this case it is the mentally unstable sharon stone <-1>
{} what goes for comedy in this film has to do with his whiny relationship to the muse <0>
the muse is demanding gifts from tiffanys from him and must be placed in an expensive hotel suite later on she will occupy the bedroom of his house with him forced to sleep in the guest house <0>
he also must run errands for her and cater to all her whims <0>
she in return helps him out by suggesting he go to the aquarium in long beach and find something there to use for an idea <0>
that dumbness prevails and he comes up with a lame idea for a film in which he wants to have jim carrey star in is supposed to be his way of saying that hollywood doesnt know whats good from whats crap or doesnt care <0>
his wife will also be inspired by the muse she will go successfully into the cookie business a source of some more whining comedy on his part <0>
this is i love lucy kind of humor <0>
{} that this film is about making money being tantamount in hollywood to creativity is a theme that has been often done and this film has not touched on any new ground with that concept <-1>
if you make a satire it better be funny or if it is a more serious film it should try to have a script with some characters who are profound and perceptive <-1>
to have a satire with nothing to dig into is unfortunate as brooks chose to go for his laughs by having his character be a whiner grousing about the demands of his muse the attention she gives to his wife instead of him how steven spielberg snubbed him and how cruel it is to be in hollywood if you are a creative person <-1>
this slight aim at comedy turns this film into a slight film <-1>
if you really had to see this film the only reason i could think of doing so was to see the attractive sharon stone as a muse <-1>
even though the script did not provide her with material that was funny she did show by her facial expressions and body language that she has a penchant for comedy if given a chance <1>
at least she was more lovable than any one else in the film was <1>

[17150/b]
{} we need myths to live by says the heroine of this film estelle randy danson <0>
and somehow rappaport concocts a mythic love tale around this premise that is similar in some aspects to the orpheus and eurydice myth whereas orpheus rescued his love from hades but even though he was told by the gods not to look back or she would disappear he did look back because of his insecurities and fear that eurydice would think that he didnt care for her anymore <0>
{} the estranged relationship of the sisters estelle and lena jones is somewhat reconciled as they start living together after a long absence from one another mainly because estelle feels guilty about how she treated her sister before <0>
so she lets her live with her even though she would rather not have her there <0>
soon they find themselves in the delicate position of having gone out with the same man an extremely muted man paul kevin who forms a relationship with each of the sisters first with estelle and then by coincidence he meets lena but fails to fulfill his fantasy of having a sexual relationship with both of them at the same time <0>
{} this film is distinguished by its stylish use of opera classical painting and victorian soap opera likedramatics to get across its strange wit and rilkeanlike observations of what can be seen from life when you become a passive observer of it <1>
the observer is estelle who pictures herself as if she was the one she is seeing when she looks out at a world she feels imprisoned by <0>
{} it could be a very witty movie if you are receptive to the characters personality foibles as they mock or imitate what the reallife troubled modern heterosexuals in nyc are up to as paul acts out the part at being the tall dark silent type of macho heman who is animalistic in his attraction to both sisters estelle with her pretentious romantic soul who is endowed with beautiful breasts and her more down to earth sister who is not the romantic type but is more prosaic in her outlook toward life who is attractive but suffers from psychological problems and fits of violence <1>
{} violence somehow plays into the motifs of the story as there is talk of a serial killer on the loose in the city which prompts estelle to say she is afraid to go outside and she is afraid to stay inside <0>
she even thinks that her exhusband jack grant might be the killer since he is prone to acting peculiarly hostile at times <0>
but the killer is caught and it is not jack <0>
{} everyone in the film is a takeoff of what a real person might be like when they are going through a relationship or when encountering strangers in public places <0>
as for the later lena confronts a stalker by coming on strong to him thusly chasing him away as he absurdly tells her he should get the cops on her <0>
everyone is meant to be a cartoon character ones whom you can poke fun at especially when they take themselves seriously <0>
{} estelle provides the voiceover which underscores the striking visual scenery in the background like the starry sky wallpaper in her room that she is most comfortable with as she collects her thoughts from the diary she is writing mixing her keen observations about romance with comments such as men are attracted to women who wear a wedding band because it is like a challenge for them to conquer a married woman to her consuming jealousy and mistrust of others even those she once loved like jack paul and lena <1>
{} estelle becomes a sort of representative of all women who are bitchy wrongfully hurt in a relationship or too consumed in their fantasy world of what a guy should be like to ever form a lasting relationship <0>
the films aim is to be humorous about this <0>
even the final scene where she at lasts burns her diary similar to the women lib bra burnings can be taken both as comic or dramatic theatrics <0>
in any case this is a very unusual and original work that is sometimes slowgoing missing the mark by being too outrageous and covering far too much ground for its own good but more often than not it is right on the mark using its token males paul as an insignificant stud a servicer of the female race and jack as an untrustworthy spouse perceived as being capable of violent acts as the sisters encompass the gamut of womanly wants in a man in a most peculiar way <1>
{} this film should appeal to urban dwellers who have been in a triangular heterosexual relationship and came out of it more confused than when first entering it and to those who have a more tolerant and sophisticated attitude toward impossible relationships <1>
and as estelle so ably says after her burning ritual i need some new myths for my life the old ones dont work anymore <0>
this film is a parody of the orpheus myth and as estelle says she gave paul two chances to get her out of hell but he failed both times orpheus was given only one chance <0>
{} incidently the funniest line in the movie is reserved for paul who tells estelle i wouldnt even tell you a lie much less the truth <1>
i think that line summarizes what the movie is ultimately about <0>

{} given the context of the material for this pulp thriller it is surprising that this english speaking chabrol film set in st tropez is as diverting and suspenseful as it is <2>
credit must be given to an ingenious script and acting kudos especially for romy jean franis and pierre for making it possible for us to be fascinated with all the twists in the ever changing plot <2>
the storyline starts off simply as a case of a boorish wealthy husband louis steiger and his attractive younger wife julie romy having a bit of a row in front of julies new acquaintance her handsome neighbor jeff paolo who introduces himself as being a hack writer <0>
louis drunkenly asks his wife in front of jeff why dont we ever make love <0>
the obvious affair between julie and jeff begins as soon as louis retires for the night and with chabrol you know that is just the beginning of more mysterious things to ensue <0>
{} chabrol will go on to explore many of the themes he has used before to belittle the bourgeois lifestyle to question why sex is the most important thing in a relationship and how money is such a psychological part of ones mindset <0>
this is all done as the cheating couple decides to kill louis and dump his body in the sea so that he will never be found and julie can inherit everything and when things quiet down they will get back together <0>
{} a visiting paris police inspector and his friend the local police inspector take an interest in the case suspecting foul play never convinced of julies story that her husband is missing <0>
they come to the conclusion after much spirited conversation about the case over some hearty meals and good liquor that she is having an affair with jeff as important clues pop up like her missing earring in jeffs apartment an envelope addressed to jeff postmarked after her husband was reported missing that is found in the front seat of a crashed car over the side of the seacoast a car that julie told the police her husband loaned jeff and then there is the information they gathered from louiss doctor that louis made up the story of having a heart condition because he was ashamed of his impotency and wanted julie to think that he couldnt perform because of his bad heart <0>
the gut feeling of the police is that julie and her boyfriend killed louis and dumped his body out to sea <0>
but julies lawyer mr lal rochefort you just cant top that for a lawyers name as he goes about his lawyers business in an abrasive and madly befitting way using logic and the command of his wit to the nth degree to get his client cleared of all the circumstantial charges <0>
mr lal is a pip a pleasure to see on screen a character nonpareil played to perfection someone who despite his small part you will remember long after seeing the film <1>
{} just when you think you think you got what is happening the twists keep coming like louis coming back to julie getting sex from her on the expensive carpet just like she gave it to jeff telling her hes a new man because of them too bad they didnt have viagra then <0>
a little freudian transference is thrown into the stew as louis goes on to boast how he outfoxed the couple staying sober one night to spy on them aware of their love making and plans to do him in he thereby jumps jeff first throwing him into the deep blue sea <0>
but if you think you got where the story is going now you better get ready for a few more curve balls thrown your way because chabrol is going to town with this thriller twisting and turning at the movement of every julie sexy wiggle <1>
{} the outcome is a satisfying one though if you start to think of what occurred of relationships changing every reel of those dead not being dead you might have some doubts about the possibilities of pulling off all the switches <1>
but by having the police using their power of deduction to amusingly follow the trail as closely and as delightfully as they can it all adds punch to the pulp story so even if you are aware that there are a few turn of events that might stretch the imagination a little too much that maybe the story did get a little too cute as there are too many places where you can cast doubt that the story would hold up to further scrutiny nevertheless it is more fun to let the story pass as it is and enjoy it for what it is as jeff turns up alive and the situation must get resolved again as julie is now in a position to choose between the new louis now able to service her properly and the dashingly irresistible jeff <1>
{} what an enjoyable film this is <2>
so much is thrown into the mix if you dont like one twist in the story there is another to soon come as the coldhearted bitchy sexpot julie becomes more important to the men than the money or their state of wellbeing <1>
chabrol even gives the justice system a welldeserved scolding saying the reason for the vagaries in justice existing as it does for women is because the law was created by men for men <1>
the film begins in irony and ends in irony even though everything about the characters involved has changed <0>
even the police seem a little smarter for their effort <0>

{} truly independent filmmaker jost has completed his socalled trilogy about rural america with this film and has since moved on to self imposed exile by going to europe <0>
this extraordinary film offers a long hard look at its subject matter as the camera is held steadfast not moving for insatiably long periods of time picking up all the appropriate nuances it needs to with deliberate dispassion as it looks at an oregon lumber mill whose owner tom blair is faced with unsettling economic news about the business he has builtup and worked at for his odd years of life <1>
it focuses on this man and tries to find out who he is using him as a metaphoric symbol for america perhaps emulating emersons views as his writings are flashed on screen exhibiting some sayings from his essays on nature and america <0>
{} by seeing who this man is we get to see how he adjusts to his carefully scripted life the flyfishing he loves to do for the sport of it his easy and almost gentile manners and his very definite american persona as he is forced out of economic necessity to deal with the japanese businessmen he inherently despises and we get a picture of a rather complicated individual who has difficulty in communicating with himself and others so the closer we get to him the more we sense that there are a lot of things about him that remain unanswered <0>
the shocker about his life that is about to unfold comes after he meets a foreign stranger on the street raving about the day of atonement coming soon and how god knows all that he should pray with him but is told by him that he has no time for that as he feels uncomfortable being around this religious zealot so he fumbles around with his wad of bills and thrusts a few dollars in the preachers pockets that are not kindly received by the preacher as he quickly departs from the preachers shouts that he doesnt want his money <0>
{} our perceptions of him as a rock of gibraltor type is squelched for good as we see him come unglued in his very comfortable home as he interacts with his wife ellen mclaughlin his second wife as she confronts him with a letter from her collegeaged daughter tracy who is his daughter via his first marriage and therefore not ellens real daughter <0>
ellen insists on reading a letter addressed to her from tracy out loud accusing him of placing his hands on her private places as he responds to his wifes question all she wants to know is it true <0>
and all he can respond is that he wonders why tracy is doing this to him saying that she is probably mixed up <0>
what results is apocalyptic as the film becomes disturbingly mysterious and evasive never settling for sure who is telling the truth but destroying the family as it is <0>
this scene could also be deemed as an attack on americas soul exposing it to questions about truth and character principles that are put under the microscope as the story builds to its very tragic outcome <1>
{} this is one of josts deepest and most penetrating films it could even be argued that he has made a classical film as it forcefully and subtly tells an american story replete with unanswered questions about family life that are haunting that give the film a certain power that makes you think for a long time afterwards what is it about this country that is so raw and violent in nature that becomes a part of the peoples own nature <2>
{} one of the scenes that i found most memorable was when the camera panned the diner where tom was dining with some coworkers and all we could hear at first was the muffled conversations of the patrons as the camera meticulously panned the diner until the atmosphere of the place was fully absorbed and we returned to tom and his conversation which became clearer as this scene played out a daily experience most americans have had but has rarely been captured so exactly on film <1>
this time consuming shot is not attempted by commercial filmmakers who live in fear of losing their audience in a long nonaction shot <0>
this is one of josts strong points his willingness to explore territory others fear to go <1>
{} josts film can be justifiably criticized for a few lapses in the story line it didnt clarify more precisely but more importantly it should be praised for the poetry it brings to its story when telling about a malaise in the american culture that is difficult to come to grips with as the american landscape is perceived as so beautiful a sight to behold and the country as so wealthy a place when compared with the rest of the world as it asks <2>
but what does this mean if americans are not a happy people <0>

{} adapted from a novel by yukio mishima the school of flesh tries to get us to believe in the sexual relationship and power play between a wealthy middleaged parisian woman dominique huppert who is in the fashion business <0>
she falls madly in love with a much younger arabic lowerclass boxer bartender and bisexual hustler named quentin martinez and is willing to pay him to live with her <0>
his great sex is supposed to be the reason she loses control of herself and cant be without him and will do anything for him even as he acts nasty and repugnant and they have nothing in common that they can talk about only sharing in an animallike lust <0>
this is asking a lot to believe and though it is possible it would have been more possible to believe if quentin possessed some charm or something about him that would give us a clue that he was such a good catch because he sure couldnt act <-1>
and since he is the focal point of all the attention able to have his way with either men or women we should also have felt this electricity generated on screen instead of being forced fed by the director into believing something was happening when we couldnt see it <-1>
{} just what was supposed to be so compelling about this relationship that would make it interesting <0>
im afraid i dont have the answer since i cant find a thing about this relationship or this movie that kept me tuned into it as i tended to drift out of the story somewhere in the middle and just watched for the street scenes of paris in the background which i found to be more pleasurable viewing than the movie itself even more erotic than the unerotic love scenes between the lovers <-2>
and this is being said by a big fan of isabelle huppert who is usually quite engaging in the various roles she has played during her long career but here it is embarrassing for me to watch her vacuous performance <-2>
{} we first see dominque pick quentin up in the gay bar he is working at after several intense eye contacts where a former gay lover and employee of the fashionable gay bar where quentin works chris lindon explains to dominque as he is badly emoting his part as a queen the lure and treachery and violence of quentin <0>
but this does not stop this illconceived relationship from taking place as they spend a night together first in a power struggle to see who is boss as she takes him to a fancy restaurant which he pretends not to like and then he takes her to the arcades which she honestly detests this culminates in a night of lovemaking where sex is acclaimed as the sole keeper of the relationship in fact the sex is so good that he refuses payment for it but she insists wanting to keep him on her payroll not willing to take the chance of losing such a good catch <0>
the only problem with this is that we didnt see how good the sex was we had to take the word of the actors that it was so good as dialogue came out of their mouths that is totally forgetable or regretable or whatever but their love was not passionate or credible <-2>
{} once quentin is paid for that is his socalled debts are paid off by dominque to chris who is probably his pimp the story limply moves along as some subtext to the already lame story is introduced about wealthy friends of dominques meeting quentin through dominque and quentin marrying their spoiled daughter with her parents approval that was unconvincingly done <-2>
{} there is one line from the film that summed up how i really felt about what i was seeing when at a fashion party for dominques wealthy parisian fashion clients quentin tells her seeing all these rich people makes me want to puke <-2>
quentin must be psychic or something because he was just regurgitating what i was thinking about the characters in this film <-2>

{} this is a simple childlike nonpolitical iranian neorealism film told from the vantage point of a yearold girl aida who desires a fat goldfish in the shop which costs tomans instead of the skinny ones she has at home for the new year celebration which comes on the first day of spring <0>
goldfish for the iranian celebrants are symbols of life <0>
{} what is truly amazing about this masterly done film is how gracefully it uses real time to take you into the countdown for the new year that is marked off by repeated radio reminders <2>
meanwhile a small radius of tehran that is familiar to the girl but not really known to her is seen through her wideopen eyes as she walks home from shopping with her mother sadr <0>
she is constantly watched by her mother but is childishly curious about the shops and the group of men who hangout around the snake charmers a place she is forbidden to go to <0>
when they arrive home we are not invited inside their home as if we were intruders but we see their courtyard and we get a pretty good idea how this middleclass family lives <0>
{} her mother is upset with her because she did not follow her closely while shopping and because she cant stop talking and whining about the chubby goldfish she wants to buy begging her to give her the money to buy the goldfish <0>
at home we meet her older brother mohsen who returns from an errand for his father who is not seen because he is showering but we hear him get angry at moshen for bringing him soap instead of shampoo <0>
{} the brother thinks she is crazy to want the goldfish he tells her you can see two movies for that amount of money <0>
but she is not dissuaded and manages to bribe her brother by giving him her blue balloon and he talks his mother into giving him a toman note to purchase the fish if he brings back the change <0>
when he returns with the banknote he is surprised as aida grabs the money and rushes out to purchase the fish going against her mothers wishes to be out alone in the streets of tehran <0>
{} she remeets the snake charmers and her curiousity cant resist watching them <0>
they cheat her out of her money but she manages to get the money back from them <0>
by this time we are sucked into accepting the importance the money and goldfish has for the girl it is not unlike our christmas time desire to please our children with gifts whether or not the gifts are worth it or not they have an intrinsic value above their real worth and we feel so happy when we see the joy in their eyes when they receive their gifts <1>
the brilliance of the film is that the story that unfolds is about the little girls adventure with the shop owners and the strangers in the street she is not supposed to talk to but does and how caught up in it we get because it is so human a story it is something that is universally understood that we forget that we are talking about iran the country that we demonized our arch enemy and if the film can be criticized it is for glossing over any of the numerous wrongs in their society that could be criticized but are not <2>
though i think that might be unfair to say since the movie should be judged for its own sake and not for any outside political reasons <0>
{} she once again loses the banknote it falls down a street grating and she cant get it out <0>
thusly we meet a tailor who is arguing with a customer and from the girls anxious eyes we see how gigantic and aloof adults can be to a child especially when she cant wait to tell him about the lost money that fell down the grating but he doesnt listen to her <0>
it is interesting to see how different he can be when another adult an older woman talks to the tailor in behalf of the little girl <0>
{} the remainder of the film is about her attempt to recover the money with her brother now by her side <0>
{} finally an afghan balloon seller is recruited to help recover the banknote <0>
he helps them accomplish the task but when this is done the girl and her brother run off gleefully to their home to celebrate the new year and the busy street starts to empty out as everyone is rushing home <0>
the final shot as the film ends is of the afghan boy smiling just seconds ago now saddened alone with just one white balloon that he did not sell and we realize that this film ends with our impression of him on our minds and the little girls adventure seems to be just one little story told and now we can easily forget about her but the afghans plight his loneliness remains etched in our mind as it affects the sensiblities we have about family life and makes us reflect what it is to be a foreigner in a country where family life is so cherished and it leaves us thinking not about any of the celebrants but about what is going to happen to him how will he celebrate the new year <1>
this is a great final shot of the white balloon in the air that is not contrived or pretentious but is genuinely a heartfelt and memorable moment of the film topping off a very human film that might surprise a lot of people that it was made in modern iran <2>
{} the white balloon is a masterpiece in its simplicity and the way its tale of the human condition is so easily related without demeaning the people involved and how childhood is explored pointing out how a child tries to grow up when faced with adversity are unmatched in most hollywood films <2>
if i had to compare it to any film that i have seen i think of de sicas the bicycle thief and see some of the same values about life in both films <1>

{} this glib talkfest is based on david rabes misanthropic play about friends caught in the web of hollywood hype <0>
what sparkles through the two hours of its production is the magnificent ensemble cast who are able to make the superficial lives they are portraying seem colorful and their story worth telling <2>
eddie sean penn is the hollow casting director who lives in a hollywood hills luxury condominium with his business partner mickey kevin spacey chazz palminteri is cast as a secondrate actor and violently unstable excon and artie shandling is their sleazy friend a big shot in a hollywood studio who acts as their respected confidante <0>
{} donna anna paquin is a vacuous teenage hitchhiker that artie brings back to their pad so that the boys could use her as a sex pet and she in return gets a free place to sleep <0>
darlene robin wright penn is the dispassionate sexual interest of mickey but the chilling lovelife of eddie <0>
after dating eddie she has sex with the suave mickey who makes a pretentiously gallant gesture of returning her to eddie saying his friendship means more to him than she does <0>
bonnie meg ryan is the goodhearted stripper who freely has sex with those she wants to one of her most inglorious moments she says is when she had fellatio in a car while her yearold daughter is in the backseat traumatized by what she sees <0>
if the movie reaches a climax of any relevance it is because of her disastrous date with phil where he loses it and throws her out of her moving car <0>
{} the opposite sex relationships are all disasterous and difficult to comprehend as the film goes overboard on dumping on all the female leads leaving no room for them to be anything but the objects of the mens failures and desires <0>
{} these four unlikable men indulge us with how they prey on the weak <0>
their constant need to talk and say nothing pursues them every moment of their day <0>
cell phone conversations and empty selfrighteous discourses trying to explain what they are about and what trouble they are in continues seamlessly from scene to scene <1>
these men are not just materialists and users of people but are truly depraved human beings <0>
{} eddie as the central figure of the story is probably the one who is the most out of it either because of his heavy cocaine sniffing or his tremendous vanity or his inability to know the difference between what is real and what is false <0>
when artie brings the sexcrazed donna for him to keep in his house as a care package he pounces on her indifferent to her as he is with everyone else he knows <0>
the only difference is that when he is with his friends he pretends to listen to them <0>
{} because of the sharp dialogue and the ability of the actors to get under the skin of their characters this morbid look at humanity seems poignant <1>
its humor is in the form of sarcasm and scorn which is a meanspirited way to look at others though mickey says he is flip not sarcastic <1>
his retorts and dry comebacks are flip humor used in the sense that we are all going under so why be that serious about life <0>
when eddie asks him what kind of friendship is this he responds an adequate one <0>
he is the one who seems to be above the fray never getting himself dirtied by the group <0>
{} the most significant relationship is between eddie and phil it was also the oddest one and the most sycophantic <0>
eddies closeness with phil is based on lies and a false sense of need one has for the other <0>
it is ruptured when eddie finally tells him with cruel honesty we need guys like you in hollywood to make the bullshit look real <0>
youre expendable <0>
you do not matter <0>
{} this is not a great drama as much as it is a black comedy that has great acting and intriguing dialogue <1>
there are no break throughs in character that can explain misfits like these guys who assume power positions and misuse the trust society has in them <-1>
dominance and establishing their place in the pecking order is what motivates them <0>
they compete against each other because of their jealousy and hatred of the other <0>
even a long lasting relationship between eddie and phil cant be viewed as necessarily a sincere one <0>
mickey tries to tell eddie this when he mentions how cold his relationship with phil is <0>
phil is very safe because no matter how far you manage to fall phil will be lower <0>
{} as an interesting gesture to the media age of the s drazen uses the tv images we view from the channelchanging eddie showing how meaningless and bland everything seems on the screen tragedies wars and football games are all manufactured as significant events by the media but all meld into insignificance in ones daily life with no followup search for the truth in these stories taking place <0>
this is analagous to the lives of the malebonding friends who make small gains upon seeing something about themselves reported by others but fail to search inward to see what they really are all about <0>
{} this was a tough film to like and an even tougher film to hate <0>
its appeal is hypnotic in the sense that we are overhearing conversations we shouldnt be hearing but we cant stop listening to them <-1>
if we met these types in our personal lives more than likely we couldnt stand to be around them long enough to be sufficiently entertained by them <-1>
for two hours to see them on film is also too long to be around them <-1>
an to minute film honed down and made more mobile taking away some of its staginess would have suited me just fine <-1>
